            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow weak and unable I am for the managing of the leaſt truth, and how unfit to appear in publick in its defence, I am very ſenſible and filled with fears and perplexing thoughts in my very ſoul, leſt I ſhould do any thing but for the Truth, and for the peace of our unſetled Church; or ſhould be injurious to ſo good a cauſe, which I am drawn out (I doe not well know how) to vindicate. Who is ſufficient to defend the Truth! I tremble to think how many precious and choyce Servants of the Lord, and faithful Labourers in his Vineyard, are againſt me in what I publiſh. I reverence and eſteem thoſe of the Presbyterian judgement above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſome conſiderable reſpects, and verily judge them conſcientious men, and ſuch as I look upon as beſt qualified, for promoting the Goſpel truth, and the Churches peace. And although my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> be ſomewhat round,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53614:3"/>yet I hope I doe not much reflect upon moſt of the Presbyterian judgement, notwithſtanding his ſeeming to write in the name of all of that perſwaſion. I do profeſſe my ſtudy was to ſpeak my very heart in this Controverſie, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke different mindes to give ſome ſtronger grounds for their opinion and practice; aſſuring my ſelf, that a great deal more muſt be ſaid againſt that <hi>Free Admiſſion to the Sacrament,</hi> which I plead for, then any of late have ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> or my ſelf will be anſwered, and many thouſands in the Nation, (which I hope fear God) will be ſatisfied. I may ſafely ſay, with a good conſcience, it is more the clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of my judgement and conſcience, that perſwades me to appear in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, then any private intereſt or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of opinion, or ſpirit of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or baſeneſſe of that ſpirit either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o humor or flatter the common multitude. I am perſwaded it is the very ſimplicity of holy Truth which I have undertaken to defend, leading directly to the Churches Peace and Reformation. Truth ſeeks no
<pb facs="tcp:53614:3"/>corners, but is invincible, and intire in it ſelf; it may be over-born at a puſh, but will recover again, and vanquiſh all the dark parts of man. O that we had ſuch impartial and unbyaſed ſpirits, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all truth in the love of it! Let me intreat my Reader to weigh things met with in this controverſie deliberately; and then I doubt not, but of whatſoever judgement he be, he will confeſſe my principles and arguments are rational, and much the drift and ſcope of plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And if he will but grant me In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, he will finde it a hard task to overthrow any of my building, as it is ſtated. He may ſee with what clearneſſe and eaſe I have anſwered to what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt my firſt book, in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this; and alſo to what is brought in defence of Suſpenſion as diſtinct from Excommunication, as it is ſtated by Mr. <hi>Collins.</hi> Indeed he pleaſeth himſelf with telling his Reader my principles are both large and rotten, but if he think to goe but an inch narrower, he will finde it a moſt difficult task to free himſelf of that charge laid againſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:53614:4"/>making void the Commandements of God by their Traditions: He cannot go a jot narrower, but he muſt uncovenant, undiſciple, and unduty thoſe which he cals Church members; the doing of which plucks up all that the Church ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and levels Chriſtians not Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Pagan world, in point of right and actuall duty of receiving. This is ſo irrational that it ſtands Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> upon to doe his utmoſt to give ſome ſatisfaction therein; which if he doe, he muſt make good from the Scriptures thoſe things which he ſo often begs;</p>
                  <p>As 1. That the Lords Supper is ſtrong meat only.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſeal to juſtifying faith only.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And that every unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Church that receives, eats judgement to himſelf more then in any other Ordinances of Word and Prayer, he doing in each what he can to decline and avoid profaneneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That a Church-member of years, under Toleration of the Church, is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever or diſciple under actual duty, as a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53614:4"/>
                  <p n="5">5. That to the different ſtate of the Church, as conſiſting of regenerate and unregenerate, is under different rules and duties, as to publick worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That more knowledge and holineſſe is required to the Lords Supper, then to Baptiſm in perſons of years.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He muſt prove Suſpenſion diſtinct from Excommunication a Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and for what ſins.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That ſome baptized of years men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture have been denyed the Sacrament of the Supper for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or for not having fruits of holineſſe anſwerable to the Chriſtian Profeſſion; and yet allowed the liberty of all other Ordinances in the Church as members.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. He muſt prove a Paſtoral or Church tryal by examination of Church-members fitneſſe or unfitneſſe neceſſary to admitting to the Sacrament, and more ſuch like things, before he can juſtly debar any from the Sacrament, more then from the reſt of Church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and duties: If he can make good all or any of theſe things by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo as to take off what we have
<pb facs="tcp:53614:5"/>excepted againſt them; then he may doe ſomething towards giving ſatisfaction in this Controverſie: otherwiſe in plain terms, I would have him to ſit ſtill, and let others (who may think to doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in order to it) put forth their ſtrength. For I am willing my grounds and principles ſhould be tryed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. I had rather be put to ſhame a thouſand times, then upon miſtake in any thing I ſhould diſſent from godly men, and draw any into errour. But yet I would have you to know, that theſe grounds and principles, on which my judgement is built, have been ſo long received and chewed upon, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined and tryed by general rules of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon, that I ſhall not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be removed. For I dare boldly ſay, the ſubſtance of what I write, I received not from <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prinne,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Humphrey;</hi> my judgement was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſatisfied in theſe things long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heard of theſe Authors. And beſides what reaſon hath Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> to charge us with this, that we are <hi>Eraſtus</hi> his ſcholars, when he findes us ſo point
<pb facs="tcp:53614:5"/>blanck againſt him, in defending the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cal cenſures of the Church? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that ever I read any Author that came up to my opinion or judgement in theſe things in any meaſure, til now of late I ſaw Mr. <hi>Humfreys</hi> Vindication of free Admiſſion. So that whether my grounds be new or old, I have made but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in reſpect of humane authority; this I am ſatisfied in, that my grounds are ſuch as accord with the Goſpel Covenant, and the ſtate of the Viſible Church of Chriſt, as it is conſtituted in Parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, good and bad, called and choſen. And I finde that men of different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments run themſelves upon dangerous rocks of Schiſms, Separations, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diviſions in the Church; beſides their interferings, contradictions of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and detracting unworthily from Covenant-relation, Church-memberſhip, Sacraments, ſigns, and pleadges of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant love to the whole Church in general. And therefore I hope, though I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to remove an unneceſſary Bar, yet it will appear that I am not guilty of that ſin and curſe that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
<pb facs="tcp:53614:6"/>in ſaying, Was it our grief former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we had no Bar, and is it our work now to remove the Bars? yea, the Lords and the Churches ancient Land-marks?</p>
                  <p>But who are moſt faulty in this? they that plead for the Churches Land-marks and rights, or they that unjuſtly defraud the Church thereof, laying the Church common with the world; judge ye: or who are moſt for Reformation accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Scripture Canon; they that preſſe to all Scripture obedience, or they that exempt Chriſtians from ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duties of Worſhip; they that would have all in the Church dealt with as members, in a Juridical way, to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; or they that unchurch them, undiſciple them, and ſo unduty them, and level them with the Pagan World. Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> pretends much zeal in his Epiſtle prefixed to his Book; but I could wiſh he had more ſound judgement and knowledge in theſe things, to abate the inconſiderate noiſe he makes, and the paſſion which he ſhews therein. Firſt, he tels us that it was a burden that lay upon our ſouls, that in the Prelates dayes there

                     </gap> might have ſatisfied men of his perſwaſion. The truth is, both Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian and Browniſts make ſuch a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thing of Covenant relation, the ground of baptiſm in the Church, that it will not bear up what they ſhould build upon it afterwards; for they make it upon the matter but a meer titular or nominal thing; reſtraining the Goſpel Covenant to believers only in a ſtrict ſenſe, making Sacramental Seals invalid, if they doe not ſo believe, conceiving that if perſons in the Church by their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual offending diſcover themſelvs to be in an unregenerate ſtate after baptiſm, that then they are out of Covenant, and ſo by conſequence have forfeited their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al right to Sacramental ſeals thereof; making no difference between ſuch and
<pb facs="tcp:53614:7"/>the Pagan world. But if we hold to the Covenant made to the Church and their ſeed, as it was publiſhed and declared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all along to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and look upon the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church as graffed into them, and equally children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith and Baptiſm, as the <hi>Jew</hi> by nature and Circumcſiion, preſſe all to walk up to their profeſſion as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians according to Goſpel obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being bound to obſerve all things as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, then ſhould we build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a foundation of truth that would be immoveable, and bear up as much as we now plead for. But I have expreſt my ſelf more largely in this enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and may not now inſiſt upon the largeneſſe of the Goſpel Covenant. In ſhort then I conceive, that it is a very great miſtake to narrow the Goſpel Covenant unto this, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved, but he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant, 1. That this is a truth as taken in the uſual ſenſe, but then I deny that it is the whole Covenant of grace made unto the Church and their ſeed.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53614:7"/>
                  <p n="2">2. I grant it a conditional propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uſed in the firſt tender of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel unto Infidels, to move them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, and ſo to bring them into the viſible Church; but I deny that this in like manner was, or is to be preached unto the viſible Church, that profeſſe their acceptance of Chriſt, and all obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances appointed by him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I grant that actual believing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, was the only thing that fitted a Pagan for Baptiſm, and graff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Goſpel Church, in which the promiſes of grace and glory belong to the whole indefinitely; but yet I deny that there is any promiſe of grace in thoſe words, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved;</hi> it is true, there is the promiſe of being ſaved upon condition of ſincere believing; but there is no promiſe in that to give a ſinner grace to believe. So that this conditional part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in a ſtrict ſenſe, as it is uſually urged alone without the abſolute, renders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinners, uncapable of any good news by the Goſpel, it not being in the power of any of himſelf ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
<pb facs="tcp:53614:8"/>And to make the death of Chriſt a ſeal to confirm this conditional part of the Covenant only (as being that which the Sacraments hold forth) is to make the death of Chriſt a ſeal to confirm a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works in the Church derogatory to the Goſpel mercy and grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to conceive of the Covenant, as it's held out to the Church by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, the Church being built upon both. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. it is largely laid down, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Apoſtles to the Church in Goſpel times, <hi>Act,</hi> 2.39. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25, 26. &amp; 5.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8, 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.18. &amp; 7.1. compared. Theſe Scriptures prove that the Apoſtles did uſually apply thoſe old free grace promiſes, (with the end of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world to confirm them) to the Goſpel Church. But if any pleaſe to enter their exceptions againſt theſe my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Covenant, I ſhall be glad both of an occaſion and opportunity to inſiſt more largely upon them. For I muſt confeſſe, I think there are not many that are very right about the nature and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:53614:8"/>of the Goſpel Covenant made to the Church; and that ſtraitning the Covenant too much occaſions very much diviſion and ſchiſm in the Church. But Reader, I will detain thee no longer in the porch; only let me intreat a candid and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conceiving of my ſenſe, drift and end in what I have written: I would provoke none, but leave the probability of what I have aſſerted from Scripture and reaſon, to the conſideration of all. Only this let me tell thee by the way, That Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it's ſtated by Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> I judge to be ſufficiently confuted in the latter part of this Book. What himſelf or any other may doe further in ſtating it, and proving it by Scripture or reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thence, I know not; I think who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever undertakes it, will finde it a hard task to make this good; <hi>That ſome Church-members of years, and indued with reaſon, ſhall and ought to be denyed the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Lords Supper, and yet be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the liberty of all other Communion in acts of worſhip as Church members at that preſent.</hi> And though I doe not in plain terms prove it an invention of men,
<pb facs="tcp:53614:9"/>yet I conceive I have ſo removed the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and reaſons it's pretended to be built upon, that it doth not yet appear to be the Ordinance of Chriſt, and ſo by conſequence, that it is but a Tradition of men. Jeſus Chriſt commands all that are Diſciples, Church-members, to obſerve all his commands, from which none that are baptized can be excluded without equal authority to that of Chriſt. Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Sacrament only, muſt firſt be proved an Ordinance of Chriſt, before any may be ſuſpended from it. For no authority on earth can diſoblige from actual duty, but the ſame that doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to duty; I mean no authority can doe it but that of Chriſt, in giving the power of the keys of the Church, to binde and looſe authoritatively. To conclude, let none deceive themſelves in reading this Book, as if it were intended for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of promiſcuous Communion; for what I intend therein is to juſtifie a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Communion in the Lords Supper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the rules of the Law and Goſpel; and ſure that is the moſt pure Communion that is moſt agreeable to
<pb facs="tcp:53614:9"/>rule, as the caſe now ſtands in our Church. Mixt Communion properly is to admit an Infidel, Jew, or Pagan unbaptized to the Sacrament, that denyes or knows not that Chriſt is come in the fleſh; or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Excommunicate, before they have given ſatisfaction to the Church by their repentance and amendment of life: If I ſhould plead for ſuch a Communion, then it would reflect upon me to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach &amp; ſhame. But I plead not for this, but for Church diſcipline to reform the diſorderly in the Church Juridically. I would have the Church ſtill to preſerve the form of all neceſſary duties of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though they cannot bring up all to the power of godlineſſe, as is deſirable. Better to keep up Religion, though but in the right form, then not at all. What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can any have to diſcourage from any religious form of true worſhip, under this pretence, that they come not up to the inward power, which is undiſcernable for the moſt part? Form and power are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable in the true Religion, where the Lord gives his bleſſing. That place of <hi>Timothy</hi> is uſually miſunderſtood in our
<pb facs="tcp:53614:10"/>times: for it is clear they had not ſo much as the external form of true Chriſtian Doctrine and Worſhip, but ſuch a form of godlineſſe as Heathens have or may have: for it was ſpoken of falſe teachers and ſeducers, that uſually make pretences of a form of godlineſſe of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, and deny or be enemies to the form of godlineſſe, which is according to truth commanded of God; for they are ſuch as reſiſt the truth, men of corrupt mindes, reprobate concerning the doctrine of faith. God never bleſſes falſe forms of worſhip with his powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, working grace in them that out of ſtrong deluſion have invented thoſe forms: but forms of his own preſcribed worſhip, are the power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom he will.

And alſo for the further ſatisfying both of the weak and plain minded Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: As alſo the confirming of thoſe my friends, that cordially imbrace my Book, and adhere to the truth aſſerted therein: And that the controverſie it ſelf may come to ſome clearer iſſue; and ſomething more may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in order unto peace and truth, and reformation in the Church of God: in all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53614:13"/>humility and reſpect unto different mindes. I crave leave once more ſoberly and freely to preſent my thoughts unto further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, for I judge that Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> hath been too haſty in concluding that my main principles are rotten that I have made the ground of my diſcourſe, by what he hath ſaid in anſwer thereunto: for the truth is, he hath not in the leaſt diſabled any one main thing I have aſſerted, nor is willing to keep to the queſtion as it's ſtated, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to any purpoſe, where the main ſtreſſe of Controverſie lies; but trifles about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and diſtracted, and Pagans, and the excommunicate, the admitting of which, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſuch, not any in our times plead for. And therefore he might have ſaid leſſe to theſe; and more to thoſe that the thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie concerns: namely, <hi>Whether the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, or ignorant and ſcandalous members in the Church, being baptized, and of years, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, may be debarred the Lords Supper, they expreſſing their deſires to receive and proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves.</hi> I anſwer in the negative all along, that they may not be put by Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> ſeems to be offended with my charging the Reverend Doctor with unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly dealing. A thing, ſaith he, that my ſelf am more guilty of; which I think is hardly ſo, unleſſe the worthineſſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon my opinion ſtrikes at doth ſo much the more aggravate the thing. As for my not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53614:13"/>taking notice of Mr. <hi>Humfreys</hi> reflections as he cals them: it may be better excuſed as to my ſelf and friend, then the other can.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe that part of the Book which concerned the Doctor, was finiſhed and gone from me towards the Preſſe, before ever I knew of Mr. <hi>Humfreys</hi> rejoinder.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When I did read it over, I thought his returns (to ſuch bitter cenſures and invectives againſt him) were very pathetical, yet hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and melting, and well becoming a ſober charitable Chriſtian, and fellow-labourer with the other in the holy Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I have heard many godly and learned in the Miniſtery acknowledge that his returns are humble and charitable, and yet quick and rational. As to Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> quotation of the two laſt pages of his rejoynder; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> little thought that any would be ſo uncharitable as to take his Allegorical reproof and caution in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feemly ſenſe that Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> will force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; there being not any Scripture unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a rational application: And thoſe that are impartial and ſober, can judge no leſſe of that. And for thoſe ſix or ſeven diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactions of mine concerning the practice of ſome Presbyterians unaſſociated, I know not how I ſhould have expreſſed my ſelf more modeſtly, then by profeſſing my ſelf unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, giving ſo many hints as I have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done againſt thoſe things I charge them

And I am ſure if the main principles in my Book ſtand firm, (as I think they will for any thing yet ſaid againſt me) Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> will not be very zealous for ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor Suſpenſion diſtinct from Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Church examination of her members into actual receiving, nor leaving out without any judicial proceedings.</p>
                  <p>But to the matter it ſelf, let us ſee what he hath ſaid againſt that.</p>
                  <p>Firſt his demand is, <hi>What it is that gives one right to the Sacrament of the Supper, he knows the anſwer will be Church memberſhip; either this alone, or ſomething elſe; if this alone, then Infants and mad men, and drunkards must come ſay what they can, if they ſay not Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alone doth give a full right, then many of their arguments fail</hi>

                     </label> That Church memberſhip alone gives one a legal right to the Lords Supper, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto Goſpel rules, the which right is a true right, and that ſufficient unto free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all in the Church: but then this right is to be diſtinguiſhed into a real right in point of title, and a right of actual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and injoyment: the former right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects all Infants born of Chriſtian Parents, the latter right belongs unto all Church-members of years, that are baptized, and in a rational and Church capacity actually to enjoy their right. An heir in his infancy hath as true a right unto his Fathers land he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53614:14"/>being dead, as an heir at full age: but yet it doth not follow that a childe under age ſhall be left actually to manage his right himſelf in that ſtate, as an heir at one and twenty. We know the Apoſtle ſaith it, An heir under age differs not from a ſervant though he be Lord of all. Yet ſuch is the the conſequence of Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> touching In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Communion; if we grant them a true right as members in point of title, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote right actually to injoy aſſoon as they are in a natural and rational capacity, then ſaith he, they as members muſt come, ſay what we can to the contrary.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53614:15"/>but Infants and diſtracted cannot, and are excuſed; yet notwithſtanding all this wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the premiſes, Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> without an anſwer unto ours, moſt peremptorily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his conſent unto the Doctors weakneſſe, and tels us the Doctor ſaith right, that by the ſame reaſon we except againſt Infants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may except againſt the ignorant and ſcandalous. Thus you may ſee, let the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be never ſo different, they muſt hold to their concluſion, be it never ſo abſurd and irrationall: and I would have them to take notice that,</p>
                  <p>We doe not except againſt Infants and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as a puniſhment or cenſure (as they) of the ignorant and ſcandalous: but rather we wave them as ſuch that are under a ſtate of weakneſſe and impotency (by the wiſdome and providence of God) inevitable.</p>
                  <p>We do not except againſt Infants as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true right,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but out of the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their natural and rational incapacity actually to injoy their right.</p>
                  <p>We doe not except againſt Infants and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe they cannot examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, diſcern the Lords Body, (as Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> would have it) But becauſe ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and diſcerning the Lords Body, coming to receive, are not their actual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but we judge all theſe are the actual duties of ignorants, and of the ſcandalous in the Church, untill they be excommunicate.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53614:15"/>And aſſoon as Infants are grown paſt childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and come under the actual obligations of precepts and worſhip, our principles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to as timely an admittance of youths, that ſhall voluntarily deſire it, and proffer themſelves, as thoſe that oppoſe us.

That children come ſooner under ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative precepts, then affirmative acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; it may be a ſin for that childe to lye, ſwear, curſe, ſteal, when at that age it is no ſin to omit publick prayers, and the Lords Supper. Divines ſay affirmatives alwayes binde, but not to all, at all times; in many caſes God will have mercy rather then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as is ſuppoſed to the caſe in hand. But I could wiſh we might keep cloſe to the thing in controverſie. Infant Communion is not a thing controverted in our Church. In the next place in anſwer to his.</p>

A difference in the degrees alters not the kinde, for that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever belongs unto a Church-member as ſuch, belongs unto all of the ſame kinde, is with out doubt. We do not finde a different rule to Church-members of the ſame kinde; if good or bad openly offend, they ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt accordingly; and neither the one nor the other ſhould be denyed an actual external priviledge of the Church, untill the Church hath given out judgement againſt them by excommunication authoritatively; and we are not to make any difference in the Church about members in reſpect of extern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, the rule being only one, and the ſame unto all. Members, believers, diſciples, brethren, in a large ſenſe are as truly ſuch in a true ſenſe, as thoſe are ſuch indeed, in a ſtrict ſenſe.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53614:16"/>
                  <p>Hence Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> his demand, <hi>What it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto Church-memberſhip entitles to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> is both frivolous and improper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Church-memberſhip includes as much as can be added unto it, and yet doth not exclude the worſt born in the Church, and under her toleration. Nor did I ever think that any man would be ſo perverſe (as he) to make reaſon and age, additions to mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, they being but eſſentials to the more perfect being of a man: for that is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all that come under actual precepts of worſhip, that they are reaſonable men, and of years. There is the Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Infants, and of men, and of women, yet all is but Church-memberſhip; age, ſex, and reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not additions unto mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip: but a Church-member is the ſame with all theſe: Yet it's true too, that unto all actual obſervances in the Church, age, and reaſon muſt neceſſarily be preſuppoſed. So again, knowledge, faith, and obedience are not additions to memberſhip, but a Church-member comprehends all theſe, in his ſenſe, degree or kinde. And while they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge perſons in the Church Church-members, believers, diſciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they muſt conclude with me that Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alone gives a true legal right to the holy Supper, ſay what they can to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: ſo that the vanity of this ſuperadding unto memberſhip unto Sacramental right, is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53614:17"/>nothing elſe but a raiſing a duſt to blinde our eyes. What Church either in the Old or New Teſtament required more then mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip unto this Sacrament? all that came under Circumciſion or Baptiſm, ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to keep the Paſſeover and the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. When Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> can give a clear inſtance otherwiſe, I ſhall think my ſelf bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him thanks.</p>
                  <p>If any make enquiry what Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in its riſe and nature is,</p>
                  <p>It's a relative ſtate of perſons only that have entred Covenant with God,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> profeſſing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſely or implicitly their voluntary ſubmitting to the whole adminiſtration of the Covenant. And this entring into Covenant is either perſonal, or parental: Perſonal, of thoſe that are Pagans born, but parental in the Church who by birth-priviledge have entred Covenant with their parents. And this I call a relative ſtate, becauſe it hath its priviledge meerly from the Covenant which God through Chriſt hath freely made unto ſome of mankinde and their ſeed, whom he is pleaſed to own and make his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to be unto them a God, in a more peculiar relation, then to all others of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; for thoſe whom God chooſeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neer unto him in his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have the promiſe of being ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of his houſe. Now then I judge, ſo long as Covenant relation holds,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53614:17"/>memberſhip holds, and ſo long as member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip holds, the priviledges of that eſtate holds. It muſt be an authority equivalent to the ground of memberſhip, that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, or diſpoſſeſſe them of their right as members, which nothing but renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Covenant, or obſtinacy continued in, under the Churches cenſures, can doe it.</p>
                  <p>But he goes on in his miſtake, and tels his Reader, <hi>That I hold, it's only the exerciſe of reaſon conjoyned unto Church-memberſhip gives all a right to the Sacrament, then it follows ſaith he, That all ſuch who are able to exerciſe their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to come, and be admitted. And then asks us why are drunkards excepted againſt,</hi> pag. 22.</p>

But it's a lamentable thing notwithſtanding our ſcruples about Sacramental Communion ſo many years together, but few that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their people ever the more by doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their diligence in catechizing of them plainly and familiarly, in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.

How long is it that we have been excepting againſt poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant brethren, and yet not ordinary means uſed to prevent it more then heretofore; if ſo much: for in the Biſhops times care was taken that all did learn the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the ten Commandements; with the explanations of them, and other parts of the Churches Catechiſing; we had our ſet Prayers, that people were apt to learn; but now in many places people never hear the Lords Prayer, Creed, nor Commands, ſcarſe in the year: nor have in uſe any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon plain Catechiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ah, poor ſouls, that care is not towards them (I verily judge) as good Shepheards have of their Maſters dumb ſheep, who will ſee to every particular one that it be kept in order, and that nothing obſtruct its growth and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if any ſheep goe aſtray he diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeks it, and bringeth it to his fellows; and when either flye or ſcab doth hinder its proſperity, he will not let it alone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the poor ſheep come to him, (though he ſhould call it) but he will goe to it, and gently catch it, (although it's ſo ſilly to flee from him) and mercifully help it: he will

                  </p>
                  <p>What he means by full right, he may doe well to explain himſelf, I have told him plainly enough, that Church-memberſhip having its riſe from Covenant relation, gives a true right unto all external Church-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges during that relative ſtate of actual
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53614:23"/>memberſhip. I know that their real ſtate of ſpiritual intereſt in Chriſt, doth put mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into a higher capacity to improve their right for their ſpiritual advantage, then thoſe that are but in that relative ſtate on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of viſible members in a large ſenſe. Yet the good improvement of the one, doth not hinder nor take away the juſt right of the other. An ill husbands right in law is as good as the beſt husbands in the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by law his right be taken away. And an evill member in the Common-wealth hath as much priviledge in reſpect of the benefit of the law while he is a member, as any other of the ſame kinde, though never ſo good. The beſt ſubject is but a ſubject; and the worſt ſubject is a ſubject untill he be out-lawed, or convicted of treaſon. So I ſay, in the Church, the beſt and holyeſt man that lives, is but a Church-member; and the worſt that lives, (he being baptized, and adhering to the true religion, and under Church indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence) is a member alſo of the ſame viſible Church, and in reſpect of his relative ſtate, his right is as good to the Sacrament as the other in a legal ſenſe, for the one is as much under obſervance as the other, all are Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, and have entred it at leaſt, and hence ſtand bound to the tearms of Chriſtian obedience. There is but one Law and rule for good and bad: the one hath received the Spirit of the Covenant, that makes his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53614:23"/>ſervice ſweet and eaſie; the other is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding under the letter of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a waiting for a bleſſing, and may not be releaſed. Such have the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which is a ſufficient warranty for their obſervance of the Supper. The other not only that, but the right of ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and bleſſing through the real union and communion with Jeſus Chriſt. And Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> his ſuperadded qualifications to mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, or Covenanters to give a right to precepts of worſhip, is ſo flat by this time (he urging it ſo often) that I ſhal trouble my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with it no more; only take notice, that upon the matter he makes memberſhip a meer nothing: for doe but ſuperadde a knowledge of the things of God, conjoyned with faith in Chriſt, evidenced by the fruits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unto a Turk, or any other Pagan, or Jew, in the Infidel world, it would give them the right of memberſhip and Sacraments; and therefore at once you may ſee what clear conceptions Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> hath of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Church-memberſhip.</p>

                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53614:28"/>Scriptures, and examine what they will make to prove theſe two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lord puniſhed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for perſonal unworthineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they were puniſhed for ſome other ſins then what they were guilty of in the time of adminiſtration: which is the main thing in hand.</p>
                  <p>As for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. he tels us, (not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) that they could not keep the feaſt with malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Apoſtle exhorts them to purge out the old leaven, meaning that of the inceſtuous perſon, ſpeaking by way of an alluſion to the law of the Paſſeover, which were to purge their houſes of all leaven againſt that feaſt which continued ſeven days: reſemblably he would have them purge themſelves of that wicked perſon whom they had indulged amongſt them, and made the name of God to be evill ſpoken of, by tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ſuch ſins amongſt them, <hi>as is not ſo much as named amongſt the Gentiles, that one ſhould have his fathers wife,</hi> &amp;c. therefore deliver him to Satan, purge your ſelves of your former connivence and indulging ſuch, and then ſaith he, let us keep the feaſt, but not with malice and wickedneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread of ſincerity and truth, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would have them ſpend their whole lives ſo; the Apoſtle tels them what he would have them doe, and how they ſhould keep the feaſt, Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> tels us, he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53614:29"/>told them they could not keep the feaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he that hath but half an eye may eaſily diſcern what this place is for his purpoſe; This proves that ſcandalous perſons ſhould be caſt out of all Chriſtian Communion, for the concluſion of the whole is in the laſt verſe, <hi>caſt out from amongſt your ſelves that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which is the thing that I all along con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, the juſt cenſures of the Church; but I would have none debarred their right till then.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> might have given us ſome probable grounds to prove that the feaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was the holy Supper, and not to leave us to ſuch uncertainties; for if it be not meant of the holy Supper, what is this to his purpoſe? Let him ſhew us where the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord is called a feaſt, and that this feaſt muſt needs be that, but this is but a ſhift to hold up the old intereſt. So hard a thing it is to come off from the authority of men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, when themſelves are ingaged in ſuch wayes that men have framed. But then he goes on verſ.

                     </label> 11. <hi>And not eat with one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Brother,
<note place="margin">This Scripture is more fully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened hereafter, as alſo the 1 Cor. 10.21.</note> who ſhould be a fornicator, an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> ſhould have cleared unto us what is meant by <hi>not eat,</hi> whether, not eat, in a civil friendly neceſſary ſenſe, or not eat, at the holy Supper with ſuch during their actual abode in the Church. If he mean the latter, in reference to the Sacrament, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53614:29"/>of him where that word eat alone is to be taken for the holy Supper; and if it be not meant of the holy Supper, what is this to the thing in hand? The 9, 10. verſes doe give us ſome light of the Apoſtles meaning, <hi>He had wrote an Epiſtle to them, not to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the fornicators of the world.</hi> But in this Epiſtle he mollifies the former with ſome liberty, <hi>elſe they muſt goe out of the world:</hi> his meaning is, not to keep company in a civil friendly ſenſe unneceſſarily; but if a brother be ſuch a one, keep no civil friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him at all, no not to eat, upon unneceſſary occaſion. And ſo for that 10. chap. 21. <hi>They could not drink of the cup of the Lord, and of the cup Divels too.</hi> The main ſin the Apoſtle aims at in this chapter is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, verſ. 14. Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> being grafted into the Chriſtian Church, did bear up themſelves upon their Church priviledges too high. And hence grew fearleſſe of Gods judgements, notwithſtanding their manifold ſins, as that of Idolatry in this chapter, the Apoſtle tels them, that the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was inveſted with the like priviledges as they are, and yet for their provoking ſins God was not well pleaſed with them, but deſtroyed many of them for their murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whoredomes, Idolatries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warns them of the like in general. And then in the 14. verſe he applyes himſelf unto them in particular, <hi>Wherefore my beloved bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53614:30"/>fly from Idolatry, I ſpeak to wiſe men, judge what I ſay,</hi> for this is the thing that comes neer you, which ſome of you are guilty of. And that he might throughly convince them of the hainous nature of this ſin, he draws an argument from the nature of that holy Communion they had together in the holy Supper, which ſuppoſes them to be all of one Chriſtian body, for they all eat of one bread and drink of one cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence he would have them ſee what an inconſiſtent thing it were for them to be of this Chriſtian body, and of another Heatheniſh body too; in point of Communion they could not be of both, of Chriſt, and Belial, this were a mixture unſufferable, to drink the cup of the Lord at one time in the Church of Chriſt; and then at another time to drink the cup of Divels, in his Temple, <hi>Will you thus provoke the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. you muſt either forbear the one or the other, for you cannot ſerve God and the Devil. And this he aggravates the more, becauſe it was ſuch an offence and ſcandal to the weak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, the which they that were the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians offended in, as the latter end of the chapter doth clearly give it, and that about indifferent things, and it became thus ſinful in regard of ſome evil circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But now what is this to prove, that this ſin was in their eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily in the 11 chap. as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> would have it? for here you may conceive, that at
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53614:30"/>moſt the offenders were but implicitly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with puniſhment: but in the 11. ch. they were already puniſhed when this Epiſtle was ſent unto them, the which will trouble Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to reconcile. Beſides had the Apoſtle in ch. 11. meant their actual offending in the 5. &amp; 10. ch. then he would have ſaid, for theſe cauſes ſome are puniſhed, or for this and divers other, but as he meant no other, ſo he writes, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the only cauſe of their puniſhment, was their profaning the holy Sacrament of the body and bloud of the Lord, as hath been ſpoken to, <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond reaſon to prove he cannot digeſt the ſenſe I have given, is, <hi>becauſe it ſeems very abſurd to him, that a man who ſhould but offend in a point of order, ſhould be guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt, and ſo of judgement; and he who comes raking with the guilt of ſcandalous ſins, ſhould not at all be guilty or lyable to Gods judgements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why will Mr.
<label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Collins</hi> thus mince their ſin? Was their being drunk, and their uſing a ſacred Ordinance of Chriſt appointed for ſo ſpiritual an end, but as a civil or common Supper, but offending in a point of order? if this did not ſtrike at the very eſſence and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Ordinance, I know not what doth; doth not the Apoſtle tell them plainly, <hi>This is not to eat the Lords Supper, but their own,</hi> this profanation of the inſtituted ſigns ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them guilty of polluting the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chriſt, that the ſigns did repreſent, and will he ſay, this were but to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53614:31"/>offend in a point of order? I might adde their offending in point of order to the main. But then to the latter part, Touching them that come in ſcandalous ſins, <hi>that they ſhould not at all be guilty or lyable to the judgements of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who ever ſaid ſuch a word?

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> Doth it ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, becauſe the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were puniſhed for no other cauſe but their prophaning this Ordinance; that therefore I muſt needs hold that they that come in other ſcandalous ſins, are not lyable to any of Gods judgements for their other ſins? I ſay, tribulation, anguiſh, and woe, to every ſoul that doth evill. And yet I ſay too, it's poſſible a ſcandalous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may come to the Sacrament, and not at all be guilty of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſinning, nor as to his receiving be lyable to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; provided he come as prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and carry himſelf as reverently at the adminiſtration as he can: for his ſcandalous life doth not diſingage him from Chriſtian obſervance while he is within, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the juſt cenſures of the Church to reform him thereby.</p>
                  <p>I know for carnal wretched impenitent ſinners, to come careleſſely, and cuſtomarily, is a great ſin, and for them that out of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe, and want of affection to it ſhall neglect it when they are invited to it, is a great ſin alſo, and both puniſhable by the Lord. I wiſh all due and lawful means were uſed for the reforming of both, ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53614:31"/>might we expect a greater bleſſing of grace upon all in a holy uſe of Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments: in the mean time let us all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what we regularly can, and mourn for what we are wanting in.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> third reaſon is, <hi>becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive that God ſhould be ſo unlike himſelf, as to look upon one legally unclean, unworthy to eat the Paſſeover under the Old Teſtament; and yet look upon one morally unclean as worthy under the New?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is too bold to call the bleſſed God unto mans bar:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> becauſe he is not like to men that are not able to reach the reaſon of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will. God cannot be unlike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be ſure; but it's poſſible Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> may be unlike the truth in what he ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 28. how doth he know that God lookt upon one that was legally unclean as unworthy to eat the Paſſeover. We know that that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe was incident to good men as well as others? It will ſet him hard to prove, (I think) that it took away the habitual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of a godly man, or that relative worthineſſe of memberſhip, if not, ſuch were not lookt upon as unworthy of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, but were under a contingent neceſſity by the will of God that they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, but they ſhould make the ſacrifice unclean: for by the will of God it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto them, that whatſoever they touched in their uncleanneſſe ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53614:32"/>And we know it was a caſe the Lord indulged equally with thoſe that were in a neceſſary journey, appointing them another day of purpoſe the next month; nor were they ſo much denyed the benefit of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, as of others, that they loſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of during their uncleanneſſe, there being not the like proviſion appointed as to the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>Again, let me ask Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> why the whole Church were to obſerve the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over upon their lives; and yet he cannot deny, but in that Church in their beſt eſtate, there were many that were morally unclean, in his ſenſe; and what doe my principles plead for more in the Chriſtian Church; if I plead but for the ſame now, that upon their lives was injoyned then, even by the Lord himſelf. I hope he will not charge it upon me, that I make God unlike himſelf; but if he will make the New Teſtament ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Old, as to ſay the whole Church may not obſerve the Lords Supper, his opinion will hardly be reconciled with the unchangeableneſſe of the faithful, true and living Lord God.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you to underſtand, that the legally unclean were not lookt upon as unworthy to eat the Paſſeover at all. And the ſenſe that I have given upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. pleads no otherwiſe in favour of the morally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean (as he cals them) then the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53614:32"/>doth injoyn. One hint more: let Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> prove that the legally unclean were expreſſely forbid the Paſſeover. I am ſure <hi>Moſes</hi> knew of no expreſſe prohibition and therefore was at a ſtand when the caſe was brought before him, and could not tell what to direct, whether the unclean might keep it, or forbear, untill he had enquired of the Lord what they ſhould doe; Beſides when the Paſſeover was rejourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the laſt day, multitudes did eat it, that were not cleanſed, and were accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: And the Lord ſaid,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 30.15, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man of your poſterity ſhall be unclean by reaſon of a dead body, or be in a journey a far off, yet he ſhall keep the Paſſeover unto the Lord, Numb.</hi> 9.10. here you ſee is an expreſſe command for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean man to keep the Paſſeover. He kept the ſame Paſſeover at Gods appointed ſeaſon, as well as the reſt of the Congregation, for God appointing and ſanctifying another ſeaſon for them in ſpecial made, the ſervice the ſame in it ſelf, and to them. And yet for all this, what adoe have our late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines made about this? I could wiſh we might hear no more of it, unleſſe they can make better uſe of it then Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> doth. Now I have anſwered three arguments that made him ſo hard of digeſting this truth, <hi>That the Corinthians were not puniſhed for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal unworthineſſe, but for their actual offendings at the time of adminiſtration.</hi> For the further
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53614:33"/>helps of this hard digeſtion and edification and ſatisfaction of my Chriſtian friends, I ſhe freely ſpeak my heart for the clearing upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Why ſurely if the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were holy, then the root was holy alſo. Now I ſay, how can it be imagined, that the Apoſtle will have the children holy even of thoſe perſons that in chap. 11. he judged perſonally unworthy? Sure if the children were foederally holy, then their parents were too, for the right of the childe is derived from the believing ſtate of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; &amp; that was ſufficient to free them from unworthy eating in reſpect of their perſons.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53614:33"/>And therefore the Apoſtle concludes that all things are ſanctified to the Church by the Word and Prayer. <hi>To the pure all things are pure, but to the unbelieving and impure is nothing pure.</hi> Here is a clear difference between the profeſſing Church and the infidel world: all is clean to the one, but nothing clean to the other. And therefore the Sacrament could not be polluted by the believing <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,</hi> in reſpect of their perſons. It will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low then that it was profaned by their evill actions only. The Apoſtle underſtood the nature of the Goſpel Church better then thoſe I have to deal with in this controverſie. He underſtood the right rule, and accordingly reduced all unto it. He diſtinguiſheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween clean and unclean, believer and infidel: all was clean to the one, and nothing clean to the other, that except the <hi>Corinths</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Infidels unto the body and bloud of Chriſt to pollute it, perſonal unworthineſſe could not be the ſin for which they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; Heatheniſh uncleanneſſe the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed might not eat thereof.</p>
                  <p>I tell you this is that which hath undone us of late, we make the ſame difference in the Church, that the Apoſtle made between the Church and the world. And all thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on which this difference is declared by the Apoſtle, our Divines uſually apply to the different ſtate of perſons in the Church, the regenerate and unregenerate; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly

And untill ſome better grounds be produced for the ſatisfaction hereof, then Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath given, I am not like to be anſwered in this very thing. And let me tell Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and all that are friends to his judgement, that they muſt make out that very thing by holy Scriptures, or elſe themſelves will be forced to yeeld the cauſe, and not ſo much as threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their poor people any more with the murder of Chriſt, and eating and drinking their own damnation: for as to that which is viſible, which man is to judge of in the act of publick adminiſtration, what fault can any of you finde? I could wiſh that in all other publick Worſhip, all perſons would carry themſelves as reverently, and be as ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and intent in their attendance upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment. It's a ſtrange thing to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53614:40"/>me, that although you cannot charge upon your people the profanation of the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in that way that the <hi>Corinths</hi> were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for, yet you fright them with the ſame danger, and are more ſevere in barring them from it, then ever we read of by any Apoſtles or Elders in Scriptures. In all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties of publick worſhip, you preſſe your people to be frequent in; and to doe their homage to God as well as they can, you will tell them is better then to neglect them. And only touching this publick duty of the Sacrament, you tell them they had better to forbear. And it is a leſſe ſin not to come, then to come, although they come as prepared as they can. When this is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent to all in the Church, that are baptized, and of years ſufficient to come under the obligation of poſitive precepts, as any other is. The uſual grounds you have given will never hold, becauſe you have run your ſelves upon ſuch miſtakes about this main place of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and I verily believe I have made ſuch exceptions againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interpretations of latter Divines, that you will finde it a work of ſuch difficulty to anſwer to ſatisfaction; that you will be forc't either to deny our Church to be a true Church, or elſe let the controverſie fall; (I mean as it conſiſts of all baptized members in general) and act as true Scripture Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have done both in the Old and New
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53614:40"/>Teſtament. I have ſeen what a deal of pains Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath taken to make good ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Sacrament; I have weighed his ſcripture arguments as heedfully as I am able, with the judgement of the ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines, and yet I cannot diſcern the leaſt ſolid bottome, for all that he hath ſaid in that diſpute to reſt upon, or truſt in, for my own ſatisfaction, although God knows I have not the leaſt prejudice againſt any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he hath made uſe of, but am willing to try all things. And I purpoſe God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to examine the main grounds of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he hath concluded ſuſpenſion from, if I be not otherwiſe prevented hereafter: in the mean time I ſhall goe on with this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in hand. I confeſſe were this true, that perſonal unworthineſſe in the Church, did of neceſſity cauſe perſons to eat and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, and ſo bring judgment: or that the ignorant and ſcandalous amongſt us that are actual offenders upon other accounts, muſt of neceſſity eat and drink unworthily if they come, and ſo bring judgement upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for unworthy receiving: there were ſome colour for to fright men and hinder them from coming to the Sacrament: but if theſe things will not be ſufficiently made good, the ground of all our fears and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and devices is removed and taken away, and we muſt conclude, that ſo long as the outward adminiſtration is carryed on with

Can Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> prove that ſome of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that returned from their captivity, was debarred the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over for their moral uncleanneſſe; or can he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53614:43"/>prove hence, that they were all free from that uncleanneſſe? doubtleſſe if he take notice of what follows in the 9.10. chap. he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg there were many guilty of moral uncleanneſſe; and yet all kept the Paſſeover: ſo that you may eaſily diſcern how perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent this is for his purpoſe. The next quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19. <hi>And he ſet the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at the gates of the houſe of the Lord, that none which were unclean in any thing ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in.</hi> From this Scripture he cryes up a ſuſpenſion of ſome from ſome Ordinances that were not excommunicated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he cannot tell it ſeemes whether from the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over or no, and then what is this for his purpoſe? I think we never read of any other uncleanneſſe in Scripture, but Heatheniſh uncleanneſſe, and legal uncleanneſſe, that were not to enter into Gods Houſe or Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and as for Moral uncleanneſſe, either it was ſuch as was puniſhed by the Judges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Judicial laws, or ſuch as they were cleanſed from externally by their continual courſe of Sacrifices and offerings, and hence there was no ſuch thing at all, nor were any ever bar'd from the Paſſeover upon any ſuch account, that I could ever finde in the Book of God, and well might the Porters charge be, to keep out thoſe that were unclean in any thing, becauſe we know there were ſeveral kindes of perſonal unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that were legal, beſides the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53614:44"/>Heathen that might not enter into the Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7, 8. nor eat of the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And the main reaſon why thoſe that were but legally unclean might not eat the Paſſeover, nor come to the Tabernacle to offer his Sacrifice, as others in their ſeaſon did and were accepted; was this, becauſe the perſon that was unclean made every thing he toucht unclean too, and he that neglected his time for cleanſing and concealing it, that ſoul was to be cut of from the Congregation, he hath defiled the Lords Sanctuary, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.13, 20. That of <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.14. proves the ſame. But I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his other quotations in my examine of the Scripture rule. I need not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe any longer, for they are too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flingly urged to require any further anſwer. Why doth he not ſhew us ſome Scripture to prove that ſome have bin ſuſpended from the Paſſeover for moral uncleanneſs, and allowed the liberty of all other publick worſhip? the which is the whole ſubject of his great Book almoſt. Yet I am certain he can finde nothing for his turn in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: And I think he hath as little from Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for the foundation of his ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament only; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the queſtion I ſhould ſpeak unto next. But I ſhall let it alone unill I come in ſhort to examine the quotations alledged in the New Teſtament, to prove the affirmative by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53614:44"/>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> in the main body of his laſt Book. I ſhall now go on with anſwering to what he ſaith to mine.</p>
                  <p>My fift and ſixt queries are, 1. <hi>What is the remedy the Apoſtle preſcribes to that Church to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent future judgement, and to enjoy preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</hi>
                  </p>

The Bar removed.</p>
                  <p>I doe not finde that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath much to except againſt, what I have anſwered to theſe two queries in my Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 19, 20. He grants what I have ſaid is true, but yet he ſayes, <hi>in caſe of ſcandalous ſinners in the Church, ſelf examination is not enough, but there is ſomething to be done by the Miniſters and officers of the Church,</hi> he grants ſelf examination a perſonal remedy; <hi>but there are other Church remedies, which the Apoſtle commandeth the uſe of, as well as this,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>I am ready to yeeld it,

And that thoſe that are juſtly delivered up to Satan, or caſt out of Chriſtian Communion by the authority of the Church, ſhould not only be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Sacrament, but all publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53614:45"/>and all civil ſociety, ſo far as our particular callings will poſſibly admit of; but yet I am far from thinking, that the Apoſtle ever meant that delivering unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and to put from among themſelves that wicked perſon, was no more but exclude him the Sacrament. And I verily believe, that the ſame cenſure that was put into execution by the decree of the Apoſtle, was made a general rule for the Church, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their dealing with all ſcandalous bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Church, as plainly appears in the 10, 11, 12. verſes of that chapter, the which I ſhall more clearly ſpeak unto, when I come to examine the grounds of ſuſpenſion laid down by Mr. <hi>Collins.</hi>

                  <p>In charity I judge that there is not any that live under any painful Preachers,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but are ſo well inſtructed, as to underſtand that the Sacrament is a holy Ordinance of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53614:48"/>for the good of their ſouls in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And that accordingly they humbly and reverently make their addreſſes unto it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the outward ſignes, in remembrance that Chriſt ſhed his bloud to ſave ſinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is upon the matter as much as the Apoſtle requires unto worthy receiving, let it be proved that ſuch a receiving was ever blamed or puniſhed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: if it cannot be proved, why doe men bring ſuch needleſſe troubles and diſtractions in the Church by their own traditions?</p>
                  <p>It was not ſo much the ignorance of the <hi>Corinths</hi> that was puniſhed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as their profane actions, which they were guilty of in the time of receiving; it's a queſtion whether their ignorance ſimply were puniſhed at all any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then accompanyed with thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effects, the which doth very rarely touch the worſt of our Congregations in the Church: let Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> better conſider of theſe things before he anſwer them: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of ours ſhould be more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant then they of <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet ſo long as they doe not openly profane the Ordinance by their actual miſcarriages at the time of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they eat and drink unworthily, and ſo their own damnation, as they of <hi>Corinth.</hi> It's true alſo, that the Lord may juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh perſons for their ignorance under the means. But doth it follow, that therefore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53614:48"/>men may too, with debarring them from the Sacrament?

                  <p>He ſaith,

                     <hi>It will not much trouble him, what I have ſaid from Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>the Apoſtles were bound to call upon thoſe they preacht unto, to obſerve all Chriſts commands, either that proves the they were to call upon Pagans to come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; or elſe to call upon all to obſerve ſuch things that he had commanded them reſpectively, and then it will ſtill remain to prove that Chriſt hath commanded an ignorant perſon to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's very true,
<label type="milestone">

Chriſt chargeth them to teach his Church to obſerve, and doe all whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath commanded them, and loe he will be with them alwayes. Where are the Apoſtles bid? to teach the Heathen as ſuch? to obſerve all that he hath commanded? <hi>He gives his statutes and his judgements unto Iſrael, as for the Heathen they have not known his laws.</hi> This very charge of Chriſt is juſt the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of God to the Church in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, upon the like encouragement of a bleſſing.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>As Circumciſion brought all the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under all obſervances of the old ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53614:49"/>even the Paſſeover, upon their lives. So baptiſm layes the ſame ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all the baptized to come under all obſervances of the New Teſtament admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, that of the holy Supper, as well as others; hence the Apoſtle commends the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for <hi>remembring him in all things; and for keeping the Ordinances as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them unto them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and it is not good to diſtinguiſh and diſpute away duty, where the Scriptures gives ſuch a general warranty. I know not well what he means by Chriſts commanding reſpectively; if he judge that ours are within, as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were, without doubt they are both under the obſervance and diſcipline of the Church. If he judge that ours that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and ſcandalous, are without; then what hath he to do to judge thoſe that are without? there is no hope to amend them by diſcipline, or ground to baptize their children, or to juſtifie the main foundation of our Church.</p>
                  <p>As I ſaid in my Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. <hi>The Bar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,</hi> ſo I ſay again, that Jeſus Chriſt commands nothing for the hurt of his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubjects, they obſerving it according to their preſent capacity: Can an inſtance be given in the Old or New Teſtament of any any that came under Circumſion or Baptiſm, that as private members were admitted to all other Ordinances in the Church, and yet were forbidden the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53614:50"/>the Paſſeover or the Lords Supper.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſayes,

                  </p>
                  <p>If that of mine muſt goe under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a whimzy with Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi>

                     </label> I know as reverend and as able Divines as Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> appears to be, that doe judge, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative part of the ſecond Commandement includes all Gods inſtitute worſhip, which at any time he hath, or ſhall preſcribe to be done. And except Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> will deny the holy Supper to be a part of Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſhip; it muſt come under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed worſhip as well as any other, there being no part expreſt in the command more then another, it's enough to prove, that all in the Church come under the precepts of worſhip; the Sacrament being ſo, they are bound to that as well as all other: but then he ſeems to grant the thing, yet he hopes ſo is preaching of the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's true, and as I had ſaid in my Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 25, That all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters what ever are bound hence to preach <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what need we have the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but that he had rather puzle then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the weak? We know that which lays an injunction upon Miniſters to preach, or adminiſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth alſo injoyn all their people to hear and receive as private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Commandement doth not confound relative duties, although Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe doth to deceive his Reader. And me thinks it might make him bluſh to call that a whimzy in me, which is ſo ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53614:51"/>by as reverend men as himſelf, and a great deal more. But the Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may eaſily judge what poore ſhifts he is put unto, that excepts againſt the truth. Let Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> give us ſome rational account why perſons in the Church are leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto this part of inſtituted worſhip then all others, that all of the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, ſhould come under the Law of the Paſſeover, without exception, good and bad. And he to plead no duty to the holy Supper of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Church too: they being not worſe then the carnal <hi>Jew.</hi> I ſee not but upon the ſame ground he exempts them from this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he may exempt them from all others that are eſſential to a Church ſtate, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not only unduty them, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church them too. For what he hath ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore implies no leſſe, where he is bold to undiſciple them, to evade this argument, we draw from the command of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor was ſomewhat ſharp with my much reſpected friend Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> for making the act of receiving, the principal, and examination but an acceſſory, in my vindicating of him I hinted two or three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the duty of ſelf-examination is but a private duty. <q>And the private is to be ſubordinate to the publick.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p n="2">2. This duty of examination was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53614:51"/>occaſionally as a remedy to that particular caſe, of making a breach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the materials of divine inſtitution and order. And we may ſafely ſay, the end is moſt principal, the means leſſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Where a true Church doth not ſo offend as <hi>Corinth</hi> did, this duty is not ſo to be urged upon them, as to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> But it's clear, there is not the ſame offending in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as there was at <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <q>Therefore that duty is not to be urged upon ours with the ſame neceſſity of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of eating and drinking unworthily, as to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                     </q> Unto theſe Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath ſome exceptions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether it be ſenſe or no, he cannot tell, that I ſay, ſelf-examination is a private duty, and ſo ſubordinate to the publick, and then ſayes, who denyes it? But yet he queſtions, whether upon an incapacity, or neglect of the private, the publick be a duty; for where a private duty is commanded in order to prepare us for the publick, we cannot without ſin perform the publick before we have performed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; cleanſing were the unclean perſons private duty: yet till it was done, he might not come to the Paſſeover.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. What though an incapable neglect of the private, doth hinder the profitable uſe of the publick, and that it cannot without ſin be performed, doth it therefore follow that ſuch perſons in the Church may neglect the publick worſhip without ſin? if not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the greateſt to obey, and doe as well as they can with ſin; or to caſt off all care o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Grant it were, might they enter into the gates of the Sanctuary to offer unto God any other ſacrifice until they were cleanſed?
<note place="margin">In <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi> Paſſeover of the 2. month, many did eat the Paſſeover that was not clean, and were accepted.</note> We know they might not; for it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a defiling the Sanctuary, a thing threatned with death, or perpetual baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Congregation.

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:53614:52"/>
                  <p>Then to prove perſons in the Church not excommunicate may not take the Sacrament untill they have performed that private duty of examination. I have ſaid enough, to prove that the neglect of this private duty of examination in order to receiving, doth not reach the neglect of that duty of cleanſing in order unto the whole worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>In his 32. <hi>pag.</hi> he is nibling at my next thing, wherein I would have this private duty of examination occaſionally preſcribed as a remedy, or a means to that particular caſe of offending. And therefore they were to approve themſelves according to the rules of inſtitution and good order, and ſo come in doing the good, and declining the evill they had been puniſhed for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſaid the end is more principal, the means leſſe. Unto this Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No man can receive the Sacrament without ſin, neglecting the due means to make him a worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. He had thought due means muſt be neceſſarily ſuppoſed to the end.</hi>

May the main duty of publick worſhip be neglected, unleſſe a man be able to uſe all due means in order to a more comfortable and profitable receiving?

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53614:53"/>exceptions: I hope the impartial Reader may clearly judge upon what bottome we infer free admiſſion, namely, the authority of Chriſts command. Beſides, you may take notice of the pitiful ſhifts that our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are put unto, to diſpute againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſts commands: Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>He that breaks the leaſt of his commands, and teacheth men ſo, ſhall be accounted leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> Nay, if they ſhall witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus offend in one, they are guilty of all.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whether in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>there be any thing or no, he will not diſpute, it is enough he findes it elſewhere, and he conceives there is ſomething contrary to the receiving of the ignorant and ſcandalous, which is the queſtion, for the Church judgeth not of ſecret things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What he hath ſaid to this,

                     </label> hath been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently anſwered already: he hath nothing new, but the old taken for granted, which hath been denyed according to the ſtating of the queſtion. I am glad he is ſo ſober, as to ſay, the Church judgeth not of ſecrets; then I hope he will not proceed to cenſure any of his people, but for ſcandalous ſins perſiſted unto obſtinacy, if he, or his Elderſhip doe, they undertake to judge of ſecrets.</p>
                  <p>But then he comes more particularly to the queſtion.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53614:53"/>
                  <p>As firſt, Touching the inſtitution, for ſaith he, Chriſt gave it to none ſuch, he means Chriſt gave it to none that were ignorant or ſcandalous.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt gave it to none but the twelve, that were impowered with Commiſſion to Preach and baptize, heal the ſick, and to caſt out Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then, muſt none but ſuch be admitted? this would be a good argument to deny not only the cup, but the whole adminiſtration from the Laity.</p>
                  <p>But 2. The queſtion is, whether the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their ordering of particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, gave any direction to exclude any that came under Baptiſm from the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and yet allowed them the priviledge of all other Ordinances in the Church. The Scripture ſpeaks of thouſands that ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto baptiſm, and continued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers, which are the main eſſentials of worſhip: and this is ſpoken of the whole, aſſoon as they were baptized.

                  </p>
                  <p>We know that Sacraments which had their Original from God unto <hi>Abraham,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Gen.</hi> 17. were tokens of the everlaſting Covenant of grace, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, God having deputed him to be a father of many Nations. And that all the Nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was appointed to be a token unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in this comprehenſive ſenſe, that not only they that were his ſeed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſcent, but thoſe alſo that ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the profeſſion of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall be bleſſed with him, even they, and their natural iſſue alſo. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. deſcants much upon this large Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or promiſe made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the warranty of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> engrafting into the ſtock of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith; the which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at, and fell into prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and diſcontents upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the Goſpel, concluding it falſe, becauſe they imbraced it, that were always left of God, and ſo abominable to the Church as naturally deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle diſputes this thing with them, and ſaith, <hi>Is he a God of the</hi> Jews <hi>only, is he not of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>alſo?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53614:55"/>Yes of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>alſo,</hi> chap. 3.29. And he tels them their fleſhly priviledges, according to the Law, will not continue them the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God without faith in Chriſt. And by faith in Chriſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are made the people of God unto Juſtification, oppoſing faith unto works chiefly in point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as in the beginning of the 4. chapter is expreſſed in that inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> It was not works, but faith, that was reckoned unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his uncircumciſed ſtate: and hence he argues <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a father of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion, as well as of the circumciſion; becauſe he received the token of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of that faith he had in his uncircumciſion, that he might be the father of all that believe, that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe might be imputed to them alſo, and a father of the believing circumciſion too, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now then what was the main thing that <hi>Abraham</hi> is thus commended for, and bleſſed for? Why it's ſaid, <hi>He believed God, and that was imputed unto him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> But then we may enquire, what was the thing he believed God would be as good as his word to him in? Anſwer. It' was this, that God had made him a father of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though he had no child; yet he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him for righteouſneſſe. We know that <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh was not a father
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53614:56"/>of many Nations; that is not the ſenſe, but he is ſo in a ſpiritual ſenſe by religion and ſaith, and that's the thing the Apoſtle drives at, to prove him a father of all that come in unto his religion and faith; And that all ſuch are of him, and bleſſed with him. And doubtleſſe <hi>Abraham</hi> that ſaw this day of Chriſt and rejoyced, ſo underſtood it, that all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed in him, by faith; and this bleſſedneſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in his own natural family; and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto all Nations in time. And hence that is true, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed in their generations for ever, Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>and that he ſhould be the father of many Nations, and that they ſhould be bleſt in him,</hi> &amp;c. This is the everlaſting Covenant of Grace that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and this is the faith that circumciſion was a token of, and did confirm the truth of, to him and all that are in him by religion for ever, even to them and theirs: and I doubt not but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeals to the ſame faith ſtill in reference to them that have entered the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and profeſſe their ſubjection to the laws and adminiſtration thereof, but I have not expreſt my ſelf in this ſo fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I could wiſh, I ſhall have occaſion to doe more in it hereafter. This by the way to give a hint, what the Apoſtle means, in calling circumciſion a ſeal of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> yet had in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53614:56"/>uncircunaciſion, it being too ambiguouſly leſt and applyed by Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> in order unto Church-members unregenerate.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath two or three things more in the 32. <hi>pag.</hi> but finding nothing in them that doth trouble us about the queſtion in hand, I paſſe them by, though it's true, he takes the boldneſſe to deny, yet he doth not give any ground or reaſon why, but takes all for granted ſtill, though I have rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared the contrary in my anſwer to the query, <hi>pag.</hi> 36, 37, 38, 39. <hi>Bar removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall now ſee what he excepts againſt my 6. propoſition, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. 31.</p>
                  <p>I conceive that Sacraments in general,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and this in particular were inſtituted for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good of the Church of Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively taken in which every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member is included.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he grants as much, <hi>pag.</hi> 33.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and then addes, his <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> and then queries, <hi>how this proves that therefore every particular member ought in his preſent ſtate come to it, and coming ought to be admitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the propoſition be true,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> as is granted it is, then it will follow that all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members ſhould be encouraged unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of that which is for their ſpiritual good. And it's moſt injurious for any to deprive any of that ſpiritual good, that proffer themſelves, or diſcourage them ſo to doe.</p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53614:57"/>
                  <p>But he hath two things to except againſt the conſequence.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>Was not the Paſſeover ſo appointed, yet he thinks unclean perſons might not come during their uncleanneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now there is no ſuch uncleanneſſe in the Goſpel Church to hinder any.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> 
                  </p>
                  <p>They were no more debarred the Paſſeover then all other publick worſhip,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> nor ſo much, for proviſion was made for them in that caſe, not in the other.</p>
                  <p>And as that of Moral uncleanneſſe was no hinderance then,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſo not now, as hath been ſhewed, and hence his firſt exception is worth nothing.</p>
                  <p>But then 2. he tels us, <hi>That ſome reverend men think the excommunicate perſon is yet a member of the Catholick Church, and ſhall not be baptized upon his repentance: and he owning the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and being baptized, his repentance being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the Sacrament is for his good;</hi> but it will not therefore follow, he ought in that ſtate of his excommunication to come to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>It's not material to the queſtion,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> whether the excommunicate be diſmembred or not; it's ſufficient to my purpoſe, that he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt of all external priviledges of the Church during his impenitency, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he is juſtly ſentenced unto, to debar him the Sacrament. And I think all parties are agreed in this, and in this caſe I deny that the Sacrament is for his good, while
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53614:57"/>he is under the laſt remedy and Ordinance of Chriſt for his amendment or utter ruine.</p>
                  <p>Then if you ſuppoſe his repentance and ſatisfying the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he ought to be looſed from that ſentence, and received into Church communion again.</p>
                  <p>That the juſtly excommunicate are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely diſmembred is too harſh to affirm,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we be able to judge that he hates to be reformed under the Churches juſt cenſures, adding unto his incorrigible ſinning, not only obſtinacy, but Apoſtaſie. And then he is undone for ever. For what the Church bindes on earth, is bound in heaven; though the Churches main end is onely to reform and heal a diſeaſed member. Therefore though I ſhould grant him not abſolutely diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and yet deny him the Sacrament; it doth not follow that Church-members un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Church indulgence or forbearance, may be denyed the Sacrament. Theſe are two different caſes. And therefore doth not in the leaſt hurt my firſt propoſition.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond propoſition is, <hi>That the Church of Chriſt conſiſts of good and bad.</hi> And this Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> grants me alſo. And it having ſuch a dependence on the firſt, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats for my opinion this argument.</p>
                  <p>The holy Supper is inſtituted for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good of every particular member of the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53614:58"/>
                  <p>But this Church of Chriſt conſiſts of good and bad, regenerate and unregenerate; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Supper is inſtituted for the ſpiritual good of good and bad, regenerat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Doth he not baptize all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants upon this account chiefly that the promiſe is to the Parents and children? ſurely if they be not objects of the promiſes of the firſt grace, the moſt of ours every where are objects of no promiſes that Sacraments ſeal; for it's too certain, that they and theirs have not a true ſincere purifying faith to apply the other promiſes of ſalvation. This is certain, if they be not objects of the promiſes of the firſt grace, they cannot be objects of the promiſes of crowning that grace with glory: exclude the unregenerate in the Church from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the firſt grace, and you exclude them from all. And then judge what will follow.</p>
                  <p>And where he ſaith, <hi>The premiſes profit not any without faith,</hi> ſhall the want of a fincere faith make the faithfulneſſe of God without effect? God forbid.

                  <p>This difference is clearly intimated by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.39. when he ſpeaks of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53614:60"/>the <hi>Jews</hi> that were of the Church by nature as deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> he tels them plainly, <hi>The promiſe is to them and their children,</hi> ſpeaking in the preſent tenſe. But then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he ſaith, the promiſe is intended unto them alſo, but with another reſtriction then to the <hi>Jews, even unto as many as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord our God to call of</hi> them, at any time for the future, and to none elſe: they of the infidel world muſt be externally called at leaſt, and planted into the viſible Church of Chriſt by baptiſm, before they and theirs can be children of the promiſe, and in Covenant relation.</p>
                  <p>As the Pagan world is without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the firſt grace,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſo we know they are without the ordinary means of working that grace, if they be as much objects of the promiſe of firſt grace, as the unregenerate in the Church. What's the reaſon the Lord denyes them the ordinary means of putting them into execution? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If our Goſpel be hid,</hi> or withheld from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or people, <hi>it's hid to them that periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our own experience will convince us,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that thoſe that are without are not ſo much objects of the promiſe of firſt grace as them within: becauſe we ſee the fruit of it in the Church in every age and time, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of many; but ſcarſe any age of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred generations we have heard of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions in ſome part of the Pagan world.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:53614:61"/>
                  <p>Hence I judge there is a real difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church and the Pagan world; in reſpect of the one they are objects of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the other without promiſe and hope, and God in the world; and me thinks Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and the friends of his judgement, (they being godly, ſober, Orthodox Divines) ſhould be ſatisfied with this difference, I have only hinted at in ſhort; for my part, I think there is nothing more clear, and eaſie to be made out from holy Scriptures, were not men of his judgement too much learned with Browniſm, deſtroying that which our fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

I muſt confeſſe it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becoming my calling and abilities to challenge any learned reverend men; yet I doubt not but through the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, to maintain this difference I have in ſhort laid down, againſt all the contradiction of ſober Orthodox men: provided they will diſpute it from the authority of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and what may be clearly and rationally deducted thence.

                  <p>I ſay no, unleſſe Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> can prove that the Heathen are as much objects of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſes in the Covenant, as the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in the Church.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53614:63"/>they were all bound to keep the Paſſeover: Conceive how improbable it were, that all that ſubmitted unto baptiſm in the Apoſtles age, were able by a true ſaith to apply the promiſes: yet none were denyed the Supper that came under Baptiſm.

The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:53614:64"/>were uncircumciſed a great many of them while they were in their travel in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; their uncircumciſion did not diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant nor unchurch them; but they were al cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed when they came to <hi>Canaan.</hi> God was angry with <hi>Moſes</hi> for neglecting the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing of his ſons, but yet their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation held, they muſt be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And I think here is nothing againſt reaſon in all this. But then there is not the like reaſon for Heathen to be baptized, that are ignorant and ſcandalous, becauſe they are ſtrangers from the Covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, have no ſuch priviledge as Covenant relation, they are unclean, and untill they embrace the faith of the Goſpel, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves real in their acceptance of it, and promiſe to joyn themſelves with the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſing body of Chriſt, they may not be received. Theſe are two huge different things, which Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> all along levels to the ſame, and therefore his argument fals to nothing. And I would have Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and all others that profeſſe themſelves friends to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to beware how they maintain that Baptiſm makes Church-members: it's true of thoſe that are of the Pagan world by nature, they can in no wiſe be made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church of Chriſt but by lawful baptiſm: but thoſe in the Church that are born of Chriſtian parents are members born, they being comprehended

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53614:65"/>relation gives right to Covenant ſeals unto parents and children. I hope I am as clear in this point as moſt are. It's an handſome ſhifting of an anſwer, to ſay, I have anſwered my ſelf: The argument lies to anſwer ſtill. If Sacraments be ſeals of covenant love to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in poſſeſſion of covenant adminiſtrations, then ſuch a people ought to uſe theſe ſeals of Covenant love unto them in remembrance thereof, untill they be legally diſpoſſeſt of the ſame. But ours are in Covenant relation, and in poſſeſſion of the Ordinances of the Covenant. Therefore it belongs to them to make uſe of the ſeals of Gods love in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his goodneſſe towards them. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you can diſcovenant them it's a weak thing to goe about to diſpriviledge them in the externals of the Church; eſpecially the Ordinances being the Ordinary way and means of attaining the grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I have alwayes thought that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> and ſo often publiſhed and repeated, and explained to the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, and applyed to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. had been an everlaſting Covenant of grace; and that Sacraments ſeal to this Covenant: And that not only the new
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53614:66"/>Covenant, but the ſeals thereof belong unto the viſible Church. And that the agreement or Covenant between the Father and the Son, for the elect, had been a different thing from the Covenant made unto the Church, which Sacraments ſeal. If that were not an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant that Circumciſion was a fign and ſeal of, I muſt confeſſe I am out: but I am ſure it's that which I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes taught, and never heard it denyed, but by Anabaptiſts, and ſuch like Heterodox ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. It's true, this everlaſting Covenant is to be entred into by thoſe the ſeals are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto; and this entrance or acceptance is either perſonal or parental. An alien up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on profeſſion of faith, and deſiring to joyn himſelf to the viſible Church of Chriſt by baptiſm, and ſo to come voluntarily under the Laws of Chriſt, is to be received, he hath accepted of the laws of the Covenant. But for thoſe that are in the Church by nature, and profeſſe no other religion and worſhip but the true, are all ſuppoſed to have ſuch a faith at leaſt as doth argue their acceptance of the Covenant, during their abode in the Church, the which is ſufficient to ingage them unto Chriſtian obedience, and doth entitle them to external Church priviledges; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this is not enough in order to their juſtification and ſalvation: but yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part is the way preſcribed for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the internal bleſſings of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53614:66"/>Covenant, even to as many in the Church that Jeſus Chriſt was ſent into the world to ſeek and to ſave, by giving them repentance and remiſſion of ſins. Hence it is very neceſſary to diſtinguiſh of a twofold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; one common that accepts of the external part of the Covenant, which repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates doe with the elect, the other is internal and ſpecial, when God by his Spirit opens the heart, and inclines the will to receive the grace of the Covenant unto eternal life: the former is that which gives right to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal priviledges of the Church; the other to the internal bleſſings of grace and glory. The former hath the promiſe of the firſt grace, the other the promiſe of increaſe in grace, and the reward of glory. If that be true of Mr. <hi>Collins, That Sacraments ſeal to the acceptation of the Covenant which ſuppoſes faith:</hi> It's ſufficient for our opinion, becauſe all in the Church doe accept of the Covenant, and have faith. And we doe not plead for Heathens untill they believe and come under baptiſm. But ſurely the death of Chriſt confirmed the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, out of which faith with the fruits thereof freely flow. And I think Sacraments are no other wayes ſeals, then they are ſigns of his death; as it is ſaid, <hi>This cup is the new Covenant in my bloud,</hi> the cup was not really the new Covenant, but a ſign thereof, repreſentatively; as I have hinted before: <hi>Yet ſurely,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Collins, thoſe that are in a ſtate of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53614:67"/>unbelief, are not in Covenant, though they may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Gods firſt free grace.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they be not in the everlaſting Covenant, they cannot be ſaid to be objects of Gods firſt free grace: for doubtleſſe God gives grace to none that are out of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, himſelf grants that the elect are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold in the everlaſting Covenant, and many of them may be in the Church, I hope, though in a ſtate of unbelief in his ſenſe; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is for the elects ſake that we have an external adminiſtration, a Church conſiſting of moſt bad, that his elect may be gathered out of all ſorts of ſinners, and others left without excuſe, is this wiſe contrivance of the ever bleſſed God. And hence this mingled ſtate of good and bad muſt grow together untill the harveſt, experience doth tell us what precious wheat hath ſprung out of the roots of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tares. And wicked tares have ſprung out of the roots of the choyceſt wheat: let that convince us.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſaith, <hi>That argument about bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm hath been anſwered again and again.</hi> The argument is this, <hi>If parents that are ignorant and ſcandalous in the Church, be ſo much in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as to give their children right unto holy bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, a ſeal of the Covenant, then themſelves have right to the holy Supper, it being but the ſeal of the ſame Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The antecedent is granted by Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and all that are friends to his judgement,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53614:67"/>and yet they deny the conſequence, becauſe they ſay more is required to the Lords Supper, then unto Baptiſm. Unto this I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be proved,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that in in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days more was required unto the Supper then to baptiſm of perſons of years: it's clear enough, that which prepared them for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm brought them into the Church. And that being once within, they had the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church accordingly, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Leſſe is required unto Covenant ſeals of perſons born in the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (they being free born to all the priviledges of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Corporation) then of thoſe that are aliens and ſtrangers by birth; theſe obtain their freedom upon the terms of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>The ignorant and ſcandalous are in as good a capacity of the Supper of the Lord,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as their children are of the baptiſm of the Lord, they being under Church indulgence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are in an active capacity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the underſtanding heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, memory, with all the externals required unto that ſervice, their children are meerly paſſive for the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Parents are in poſſeſſion of the feals of themſelves, but their children before baptiſm are not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Parents in the Church derive as much right
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53614:68"/>from their Anceſtors, as their children doe untill they be diſcovenanted, if not more, as being a generation neerer that right.</p>
                  <p>If parents Covenant relation be ſufficient to give right to the ſeals for his childe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> then ſurely for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the contradiction in the other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Mr.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                     <hi>Collins;</hi> as firſt, he pleads the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt for the parents unto their childrens baptiſm; and then diſputes them out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in his admiſſion unto the holy Supper. They ſhall be accounted believers as to the one, but unbelievers as to the other. The promiſe is to them and their children in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto baptiſm, but then in order to the holy Supper, there is no more promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto them then unto Pagans. And there is no promiſe made to any that have not faith to apply them; and ſo exclude children from the promiſe too at laſt, for they have not ſuch a faith as to apply the promiſes. Thus you may ſee he is a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian in practice; and an Anabaptiſt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. For if his judgement be true about baptiſm, then it's falſe about the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; if his judgement be true about the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then it's falſe about baptiſm: for both are the ſame ſeal of the ſame Covenant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, only by different figns. People had need be well ſetled and ſatisfied of themſelves in theſe times, that keep their ſtation in the Church, where they have ſuch Teachers,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53614:68"/>and meet with ſuch opinions that deſtroy all. The truth is, our ſtraightneſſe in the one, and largeneſſe in the other, doth deſtroy it ſelf; and doth occaſion moſt intelligent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, either to fall off from Infant baptiſm, or elſe to reſtrain it to thoſe that are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fit to be received into holy Communion in the Lords Supper. Had it not been for our own ſcruples about admitting to the Supper, caſting off the moſt of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members from Communion, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ignorant and ſcandalous, we had never known of theſe exorbitances in the Church, which now we ſuffer under by the ſeparations.</p>
                  <p>It is an eaſie thing for Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> to ſay the argument is anſwered again and again, not telling us by whom; nor how. But if it be not better anſwered then he hath done it in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Barksdel,</hi> he muſt anſwer it again, or elſe it muſt be unanſwered, and cleave cloſe unto him ſtill as ſuch a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that he will never free himſelf of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he alter his judgement: which he will finde the readieſt way of the two.</p>
                  <p>In his 15. <hi>pag.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Barksdels</hi> 10. argument for free admiſſion he puts in three exceptions.</p>
                  <p>He grants <hi>children are baptized in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents right; but yet can ſee no reaſon,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> why it ſhould neceſſarily be the immediate parent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True, for ſometimes it may fall out,

                     </label> that both parents may be excommunicate, or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53614:69"/>turn'd Apoſtates: in theſe caſes it's not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but otherwiſe being of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church and faith, the ignorant and ſcandalous being in actual Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and baptized; give as true a legal right to their childs baptiſm, as any other member what ever: ſo long as their own right holds, their childs right doth alſo, and that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from them, is to the ſober unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Indeed if parents be never ſo really godly and unbaptized, their childrens right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm muſt either be derived from Anceſtors, or elſe have none at all, a viſible peofeſſion of faith in perſons baptized gives a true right for their childe to the Sacramental ſeal, and conſequently for themſelves to the ſame ſeal of the Supper; there was the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the neglect of the Paſſeover, as for circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith further,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>There is no ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation prerequired unto baptiſm: but to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a man muſt examine himſelf, and ſo let him come.</hi>

                     </label> to examine whether he believed with all his heart or no in order unto baptiſm. And I think that was more then the other of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinths.</hi> Baptiſm to men of years was upon the condition of a perſonal faith, without which they might not be baptized, implyed by this, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayſt,</hi> otherwiſe not, but there is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53614:69"/>no ſuch thing in order to the Supper: they were to examine themſelves, and ſo come, it cannot be reaſonably conceived of, that if they neglected this private duty, they ſhould not come, for it was their duty to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to celebrate the Supper, but not to profane it for the worſe. Profeſſion of faith was a publick duty in order to baptiſm, without which they could not be baptized: but examination but a private duty left to God and our own conſciences, which no publick officers have to doe with concerning others, but to inſtruct and to exhort unto the duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have not the like warrant to require an account whether the private hath been performed, much leſſe to debar them upon a ſuppoſal of <hi>non</hi>-performance, or prejudge of their incapacity before hand, and ſo diſcourage from coming together, for which we have not one ſyllable of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: but I have ſpoken enough to this already. Remember the abuſe of the Brazen Serpent.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>The children of the legally unclean were not forbid circumciſion, but the unclean man might not eat the Paſſeover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The unclean during his uncleanneſſe,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> might not circumciſe his child, circumciſion being inſtituted a token of the Covenant, which an unclean man might no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file and make unclean, then any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſervice. And what though it were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53614:70"/>to be done the eight day, it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed for a week upon the ſame reaſon as the Paſſeover was for a month, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in another caſe for forty years: we know the rule in caſes of neceſſity, God will rather have mercy then ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>There is no legal uncleanneſſe in the Church now,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and therefore this doth not ſo much as reach the argument; and indeed his other two, are as little for his turn: he muſt finde a better anſwer then ſo, or tell us where to finde one, or elſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will cleave ſo cloſe that he will be forced to narrow Infant baptiſm unto the holy Supper, or enlarge the Supper unto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, or be irrational and abſurd in ſo flat a contradiction, as hath been hinted.</p>
                  <p>And to prevent ſome miſtake, let me intreat the Reader carefully to conſider, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have ſaid, that more is required unto the Supper then unto Baptiſm. It is to be underſtood in the Church of perſons that are Church-members by nature. But of Aliens, I conceive more is required of them unto baptiſm, then of Church-members un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Supper, eſpecially when they were members by birth priviledge. The ground is this, becauſe a publick profeſſion of faith is neceſſary for the admitting of a Heathen into the viſible Catholick Church, by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And ſo of his entring the Goſpel Covenant for himſelf and ſeed: but to them
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53614:70"/>that are in Covenant by birth, it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, their Covenant right remains untill it be forfeited by renouncing the Covenant, or hating to be reformed by the Churches juſt cenſures. And while they are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and in the Church, they may not be denyed the external priviledges thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be tranſgreſſors of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to proceed, and come more cloſe to the query in hand, namely, <hi>Whether there be any thing in the nature, end, action, language of the Sacrament, incongruous to the unregenerate in the Church receiving, in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>or elſewhere.</hi> To which I have in the general, ſhewed a congruity between the Sacrament and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate in the Church; And have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> exceptions againſt me. Now we come more directly to the query, and to what is excepted againſt us. I muſt confeſſe in <hi>pag.</hi> 36. <hi>Bar removed,</hi> there is a great miſtake, but who were faulty in it, I cannot well tell, the 19. line is out of place, and is to be prefixed to my three arguments, to prove the Sacrament a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>pag.</hi> 40. for that which follows <hi>page</hi> 36. <hi>line</hi> 19. is to demonſtrate a ſutableneſſe or congruity in the Sacrament to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate mans receiving, where the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the queſtion are examined and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>And hence Mr.</hi> Collins <hi>followes the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and makes himſelf merry with thoſe three new arguments, as he had thought they were:</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:53614:71"/>but he findes the firſt as old as <hi>Pauls</hi> ſteeple. And the third proves a Monkies right to the Sacrament, in his <hi>pag.</hi> 35, 36.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe my nature inclines me too much to give him returns ſutable unto his vein of levity,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> but I ſhall rather chooſe to keep to the queſtion and inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again, touching this queſtion in hand.</p>
                  <p>I laid down the nature of the Sacrament to be a viſible Goſpel,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> repreſenting Chriſt and him crucified to the outward ſenſes of the body, to that end that they might be the in lets of the ſoul to give the application of the benefits of Chriſts death to the heart and conſcience. And I thought the unregenerate in the Church have as much need of the uſe of all their ſenſes to underſtand Chriſt and him crucified, and to apply the benefits that come by him, as the regenerate and more, they being more dull to underſtand, or to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the benefits and bleſſings that come to ſinners by vertue thereof. Unto this</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bravely concluded! from need to right is wide concluding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conclude from the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That therefore the unregenerate in the Church have need to be allowed the uſe of all their ſenſes, to let in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt as the regenerate, they being more dull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hence I conceive a congruity unto ſuch, he ſayes, <hi>from need to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53614:71"/>right is wide concluding.</hi> The queſtion is not to prove a right, but a congruity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to free the unregenerate from the charge of incongruity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto which Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> excepts nothing againſt the nature of it.</p>
                  <p>In ſpiritual things unto the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I much queſtion whether it be wide conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from need to right. I am ſure need and wants are the only objects of Gods free bounty in giving Chriſt, and all he gives with him, <hi>With him the fatherleſſe and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late finde mercy. If any want wiſdome, let them ask it of God who gives freely.</hi> What though from need to right doth not alwayes hold in the Courts of men; it's a good plea in the Court of free grace, and well taken when ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners come off, in the uſe of Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, for the obtaining of a bleſſing of ſupply unto their neceſſities.</p>
                  <p>In the next place,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we are to examine what Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> excepts againſt the end of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as I have expreſt my ſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. <hi>The Bar removed,</hi> as touching the query in hand, <hi>The end of the Sacrament is to put the Church in minde of the death of Chriſt, and that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made by him, by which all the ſaving bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant are procured unto faln man. Chriſts bloud was ſhed for many, for remiſſion of ſins. That he might gather into one the children of God ſcattered abroad in all the world, and ages thereof; is the end of his death, Joh.</hi> 11.52.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53614:72"/>And the Sacrament is to be obſerved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this, by all in the Church that profeſſe they hope to be ſaved by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his death; which the unregenrate does whom we cannot exclude from being the ſheep Chriſt dyed for; and therefore it's as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and congruous for ſuch to be put in mind of the death of Chriſt, by the Sacrament, for their ſpiritual good as others, regenerating grace being a bleſſing of the Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the death of Chriſt, as well as ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is.</p>
                  <p>Unto this Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> anſwers ſomewhat feebly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Reſtraining the benefits that come by the death of Chriſt, unto thoſe only that have a lively hope, purifying themſelves, as God is pure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He queries, <hi>How if ſuch be ignorant of what Chriſt is, and did; how can ſuch doe it in remembrance of him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Or how if by bloudy Oaths and blaſphemies profane his bloud. How can they doe it in a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal remembrance of him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the unregenerate as ſuch,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> have not a lively hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I grant, but that they have a warrantable hope, as profeſſing the true Chriſtian Religion, relying upon the mercy of God through the merits of Chriſts death, Chriſt being the right object of all hope; which is a good encouragement for ſuch to uſe the means in hope of a bleſſing; foraſmuch as not any man in ſpecial can
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53614:72"/>exempt himſelf from the ſaving benefits of his death, whom they by the outward ſigns are put in minde of, every Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>As before he would not have them objects of the promiſes of firſt grace,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe they have not faith to apply the promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So now he will have none to have any ground of hope to receive the ſaving benefits that are procured for ſinners by the death of Chriſt, (which Sacraments repreſent) but thoſe in the Church, that have a lively hope. Doth Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> think, thas a man may have faith to apply the promiſe before he hath grace? Or doth he think thoſe promiſes have no object? Or that any ſhall have grace to whom it is not promiſed in the Church? So likewiſe, if none but thoſe that have a lively hope can receive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the death of Chriſt; then it will follow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the firſt regenerating grace is not a benefit that flows from the death of Chriſt, except a man can have this lively hope before he be regenerate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That regeneration, as it is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the death of Chriſt, belongs to none but regenerate perſons that have a lively hope; and then we ſhall exclude the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from all benefit or hope by Chriſt; unleſſe they can convert themſelves; which they cannot; and ſo exclude them from the day of grace and mercy, and make them ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53614:73"/>from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Covenant of promiſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope and God in the world; equal with the Pagan world; which upon groſſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take he hath done all along in this preſent Controverſie. But I hope enough hath been ſpoke to ſatisfie my Reader, as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. And therefore the unregenerate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much concerned in the benefits of the death of Chriſt, which Sacraments are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers of, it's very meet and ſutable they ſhould partake of the ſignes, that are ſo much concerned in the thing repreſented and exhibited thereby. Unto his ſecond I</p>
                  <p>If they be ſo ignorant,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> they ought to be inſtructed better, which hath been ſpoken to already. Hardly can any be excepted againſt for ignorance that are intelligent, if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will doe his duty to inſtruct them in a plain familiar way.</p>
                  <p>And for ſuch as are ſcandalous, they ſhould be dealt withall in a regular way, for their amendment, that their actual miſcarriages indulged doe not leaven the whole, and hinder the bleſſing of every Ordinance from themſelves. And although a practical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance may be deſired of all; yet in the viſible Church we ſhall alwayes meet with many looſe carnal wretched ſinners, that will offend ſcandalouſly, and ſo abuſe the grace of Goſpel Ordinances to their utter ruine, if the Lord prevent it not by giving
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53614:73"/>them his grace to repent. The Sacrament is a means to ingage unto amendment, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as any other Ordinance, untill they be Juridically caſt out. Nothing elſe can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them from duties of publick worſhip, as the Sacrament is. I confeſſe it is a ſad and a lamentable condition, that ſuch wretched miſerable perſons are in, that wofully abuſe the Grace of the Goſpel, and make ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate returns for ſuch exceeding rich grace and mercy, abuſing the patience and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering of God which ſhould lead to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. How dare any profane perſons bear up themſelves upon the name of the Lord, and hope they ſhall be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, and yet live in licentious courſes, and hate inſtruction, and will not have Chriſt to rule over them by his Word and Scepter! Why, conſider this, yea that forget God, leſt he tear you in peices, and there be none to deliver; doe not flatter your ſelves the more becauſe you are in the viſible Church; for ſo long as you are but chaffe and tares, you are lyable every moment to be pluckt up and burnt in unquenchable flames. What though thou mayſt eſcape the cenſures of the Church; be ſure thou ſhall not eſcape the judgement of God, if thou continueſt thy rebellion againſt him.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deſired him to prove that faith was that hand, but Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath prevented him, and given his proof of it in <hi>John</hi> 6.54, 53, 56. compared with verſ. 40.35, 50. Epheſ. 4.17. Joh. 3.36.</p>
                  <p>The 6. of <hi>John</hi> doth prove,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> that a ſincere ſaving faith in the perſon of Chriſt is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity unto ſalvation. Chriſt is the bread of life, which came down from heaven to give life unto the dead world: he that believes in him ſhall never hunger and thirſt more, but ſhall have everlaſting life, and be raiſed up at the laſt day. And the very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body of Chriſt, as conſiſting of fleſh and bloud, without which he could not have been made a perfect Sacrifice for ſin, nor ſatisfied the juſtice of God for mankinde that had ſinned; was this bread of God, which whoſoever believed not, hath no part in. But what is this to prove that faith is the only hand to receive the outward ſigns of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of our Lord? Doth it follow that the ſame faith is as neceſſary to receive an outward ſign, as the benefits that come by Chriſt unto ſalvation? This chapter proves no ſuch thing, it having no reference at all to the Sacrament of the holy Supper: for theſe words were ſpoken long before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper was inſtituted and ordained. I hope the real fleſh and bloud of Chriſts humane body is not to be received under the forms of bread and wine; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53614:75"/>at all, for it's the Spirit of Chriſt that quickeneth: the fleſh profiteth nothing The words of Chriſt unto his, they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and life. I am ſorry the Papiſts ſhould ſee our Divines applying this 6. of <hi>John</hi> to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>I ſay ſtill as before, that taking and eating are bodily actions, and to be underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of inſtitution, which the unregenerate Chriſtians are capable to doe, and act as well as any. And it remains ſtill to prove, by Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> favour, that take and eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is meant of faith to be the hand and mouth to take and eat with; his quotations are drawn too much awry to ſpeak his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I muſt demand further proof, or elſe he will not clear the thing I am ſure.</p>
                  <p>I grant that unto actual receiving of the ſignes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there ſhould be in every one both a knowing and a believing that Chriſts bloud were ſhed for many, for remiſſion of ſins, and that themſelves take and eat the outward elements of bread and wine in that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, in hope that they are of that unmber which Chriſt laid down his life for.</p>
                  <p>I grant it neceſſary,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that every one that comes to the Lords Table, come in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty of faith, and to be fully perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of their own receiving, for <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> And hence all the Church as profeſſing themſelves Chriſts ſubjects, muſt plead for their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53614:75"/>Chriſts command, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant it good and lawful for them that truly can, in the act of receiving,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to exerciſe an act of faith in appropriating and applying the true, real, ſpiritual bread of life, Jeſus Chriſt, himſelf, with all the ſaving benefits of his death unto their ſouls; but yet I deny that this is of neceſſity required of all that come thither to ſerve Chriſt in his own Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>I grant that the outward ſignes are holy in a relative ſenſe, as reſpecting their end,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and ſo are objects of faith, and of the minde: but as they are ſigns ſimply and elementary, they are only objects of the outward ſenſes, and not of faith properly.</p>
                  <p>I grant that the Sacraments are of fingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> for the encreaſe and growth in grace of the moſt eminent Chriſtians in the Church; and yet have their ſpecial uſe for the weakeſt babes in the Church, for knowledge and Chriſtian obedience, even the worſt of members (as it is Gods Ordinance) may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good by it where God is pleaſed to give his bleſſing, as in all his other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſet up in his Church for the ſpiritual good thereof.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It's true,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Chriſts Diſciples are of thoſe many Chriſt ſhed his bloud for.

                  <p>When the Lord Jeſus ſaid he ſhed his bloud for many,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he means not only his diſciples in preſent being, that are called and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but the whole number of his elect in all ages and places of the world, for remiſſion of ſins, and the Sacramental cup, is a token and ſeal thereof, to be received at all times by the Church in that remembrance. And I doubt not but Chriſt has a great number of his Elect alwayes of the unregenerate in the Church. What incongruity in all this?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, ſome other things, I ſaid, <hi>It ſounds very harſh in the Church, to exclude this Ordinance of Chriſt from being a means of converting the unregenerate in the Church, they being the moſt proper objects of converting grace, as held out in in the promiſes, for the putting of which into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, all the Ordinances in the Church ſeeme to be ſubſervient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I verily believe, this Ordinance of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53614:77"/>the holy Supper, had never been denyed to convert in the Church, had not Divines run themſelves upon ſuch great miſtake about ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual unworthineſſe from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.

This muſt needs be a conſequence of the other miſtake, That being removed, men will eaſily yeeld the other. Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> tels us of twenty arguments of Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy,</hi> that it is not for converſion, the which he ſayes, I have not yet anſwered. I muſt confeſſe it; neither doe I know what they are, for I have not his Book. My friend Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> hath promiſed to anſwer thoſe arguments: Which I believe will be eaſie enough to doe, unleſſe they be ſtronger then the ſtrongeſt of Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Barſdale,</hi> upon the ſame argument, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. the latter end of his Book, the which argument of his I ſhall examine anon. Let us firſt ſee what he hath excepted againſt mine. Which I think are ſo much for the probability of the affirmative, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53614:77"/>muſt remain doubtful, unto the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial intelligent Reader.</p>
                  <p>That one ſpecial end of the work of the Miniſtery in general,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is for converſion of the unregenerate in the Church, will hardly be denyed.</p>
                  <p>But to the adminiſtration of the Sacrament the main eſſentials of that work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery in the Church are of neceſſity, as Word, and Prayer, and breaking of Bread, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. Therefore one ſpecial end of the Sacrament, as it is an eſſential part of that work, is for the converting the unregenerate in the Church.</p>
                  <p>The major propoſition is bottomed from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 10, 11, 12, 13 verſes. <hi>Chriſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded far above the heavens, that he might fill all things. And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers; for the gathering of Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come into the union of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect man; unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here it is plain that God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work of the Miniſtry in the hands of Paſtors and Teachers in the Church, to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the body of Chriſt, untill the whole number of his elect be united to him, and made compleat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we know there is alwayes in the Church, objects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53614:78"/>as well as of the promiſes, to which the work of the Miniſtry is intended to unite them unto Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is to be done by the work of the Miniſtry in general, without any diſtinction of parts, the whole work together without exception of any part, is for converſion in the Church, as is clear from this place. Now unleſſe Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> or any other what ever, can give us ſome clear Scripture to exclude a part of this work from that end of converſion, they muſt allow this end of converſion to the work of the Miniſtry in general, but as that was never performed as yet, ſo I think never will by any: only men take the boldneſſe to ſeparate that which the holy Ghoſt doth joyn together, upon meer miſtake about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving.</p>
                  <p>And it is a rule that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie from <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Where the Scriptures d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53614:78"/>have done with this Argument. And untill then, the Argument is of more force then all the authority of men (meerly) can in the leaſt overthrow. We ſhould diſtinguiſh of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel unto Pagans, that are aliens to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and of the work of the Miniſtry conſiſting of the whole adminiſtration of the Goſpel, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only for the ſpiritual good of the viſible Church of Chriſt: unto Infidels the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel is appointed the ordinary way and means to convert them unto the faith, and bring them into the Church; but thoſe that are in the Church as they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the promiſes, and under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all obſervances, which Infidels are not, ſo they are under greater advantages of converting them unto ſincerity of faith, and the power of godlineſſe by the work of the Miniſtry in general, of which Infidels are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed but a part.</p>
                  <p>The minor propoſition is evident, that to the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, it's neceſſary that the main eſſentials of the work of the Miniſtry in the Church be performed, as publiſhing not only the Word of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Hiſtory of Chriſts death and paſſion, with exhortations ſutable to the Ordinance in hand, according to the practiſe and cuſtom of our own Church, with ſolemn prayers and praiſes conſiderably meet for ſo waighty an Ordinance; unto which are
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53614:79"/>adjoyned inſtituted ſignes to be given and taken in remembrance of the death of Chriſt; all which concurring together in the act of adminiſtration, doth compriſe upon the matter the main eſſentials of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, wherein the work of the Miniſtry doth chiefly conſiſt; ſo that I cannot conceive how the premiſes can be denyed by any: therefore the concluſion doth neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That the Sacrament, as it is an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of the work of the Miniſtry, is for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in the Church.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſaith, <hi>This argument is worth nothing.</hi> But why did he not ſhew the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it then, his bare ſay ſo is no anſwer. But he ſayes, <hi>Let it be proved that therefore Chriſt hath appointed it for converſion; if it were, doubtleſſe the excommunicate ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have made good the premiſes,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> the concluſion needs no proof. If the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Spirit unto converſion be in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, as at the other parts of the Miniſterial work in the Church, then we muſt allow the fame effect to the one as to the other, both being the Ordinance of God, and performed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Office and Function of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
                  <p>But in the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the ſame inſtruments of the Spirit, unto converſion, as Word, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:53614:79"/>
                  <p>Therefore the Sacrament is appointed for converſion in the Church.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. This implyes that the unregenerate are not to doe any thing by way of duty, but what is for converſion, not be diligent in their callings, ſhew mercy, and doe juſtly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe theſe duties are not appointed to convert them.</p>
                  <p>Next, all men confeſſe that the Word and Prayer, as they are publick Ordinances of God, are for converſion in the Church.</p>
                  <p>But without the Word and Prayer ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, and ſetting apart the elements of Bread and Wine, there can be no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Sacrament, as conſiſting in Word and Prayer, is converting.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53614:80"/>that hath a great hole in it.

                  </p>
                  <p>Why did not Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> really diſcover a hole in the argument by ſome ſolid anſwer, but fancy a hole before it be made: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes the Word and Prayer are means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and ſo grants my major: and upon the matter grants my minor, by ſaying, <hi>that Word and Prayer doe conſtantly attend the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but yet he is not willing to yeeld the concluſion; which is not very rational, I concluding no more then what he grants in the propoſitions. But he ſaith, <hi>It will not follow, that the Sacrament quà a Sacrament is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting;</hi> either he muſt mean, that the giving and receiving without word and Prayer, is the Sacrament, <hi>quà</hi> a Sacrament, or that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and receiving the ſignes, in relation to Word &amp; Prayer conjoyned, is the Sacrament, <hi>quà</hi> a Sacrament. If he means the former, let him prove that giving and receiving the ſignes of Bread and Wine without Word and Prayer is the Sacrament. If the latter, then in his granting the premiſes he yeilds the concluſion, and thus you may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee what a great hole the hath made in this argument.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:53614:80"/>
                  <p>But then he ſaith, <hi>Nor is there any need for converſion, that the unregenerate ſhould be at it, for they may pray, and hear, and not receive.</hi>

                  <p>No!

                     </label> is there no great need of converting the unregenerate? I had thought they have great need to take the advantage of every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in the Church, appointed for their ſpiritual good, and in order to converſion. And have not they as much need to enjoy the benefit of inſtituted ſignes, conjoyned to the Word and Prayer, to repreſent the death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt unto the outward ſenſes, which are the inlets to the underſtanding, heart and conſcience, as any others? But then he ſayes, <hi>They may hear, and pray, and not receive.</hi> It's true, (ſo may any other) doth it therefore follow, that none may receive? or that hearing and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in order to receiving, is ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking, and eating and drinking the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſignes in remembrance of the death of Chriſt? Or would he have them to hear and pray, in order to receiving, and then turn their backs upon Gods holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, after they have prayed unto God for his bleſſing upon it? The Reverend Doctor ſaid, <hi>That preſence might anſwer this end,</hi> unto which I anſwered, <hi>If bare preſence, much more actual receiving.</hi> But now Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſayes, <hi>That they cannot promiſe them, that their preſence will do them good, but they are ſure,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>their receiving will not. And hence concludes my conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is naught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53614:81"/>
                  <p>Who can promiſe before-hand, that any other Ordinance in the Church ſhall doe the unregenerate good by their preſence at the time, ſhall they not therefore give their preſence? It's the language of Scripture, that all in the Church are to keep Gods ſtatutes and judgements for their good.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>he is ſure their receiving will doe them no good.</hi> I wonder how he dare limit the holy One, and detract ſo injuriouſly from the wiſdome, power, and grace of Chriſt in his own appointments. He hath confeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Sacraments were inſtituted for the ſpiritual good of the viſible Church of Chriſt in general, and that this Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of good and bad; and now he ſayes the Sacrament wil doe the unregenerate no good. Doth he think the unregenerate are not of the viſible Church, that Sacraments were inſtituted for the good thereof? The judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader may eaſily diſcern how conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he is to his own judgement, in more things then this.</p>
                  <p>But this antecedent of his, <hi>That he is ſure their receiving will doe them no good,</hi> is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to publiſh to the world, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is naught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in anſwer to the Doctor.</p>
                  <p>But why doth Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> give us his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the negative? He turns me over to Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy,</hi> that hath twenty arguments. I ſuppoſe himſelf may uſe ſome of them in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53614:81"/>his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Barkesdales</hi> 9. argument, wherein he ſeemes to make a ſhew of ſilence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men, that hold the Sacrament a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. And becauſe the argument which he anſwers unto, is the ſame with mine, I ſhall crave leave of Mr. <hi>Barks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> to examine in brief the ſtrength of his, becauſe he thinks he hath done enough at once to ſhew thevanity of our opinion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He argues from the abſurdities that will follow: Then it is as proper to go to the Heathen and call them to a Sacrament, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their converſion, as to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel unto them.</p>
                  <p>It concerns Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> to prove that every Ordinance in the Church inſtituted for the good thereof,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> doth belong unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and ſuch, and may be uſed for their good.</p>
                  <p>Let him prove that the unbaptized Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then are as much in Covenant relation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and under the obligation of all Chriſtian obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, as the unregenerate Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Let him prove that whatſoever is for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is for the good of Heathens as well as preaching the Goſpel. The exerciſe of diſcipline is for converting an offending brother, doth it follow that Church diſcipline is to convert Heathens, to whom it never was intended or appointed? Beſides, we know the unbaptized is not to eat thereof; were there the like ground to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53614:82"/>the unregenerate Chriſtian, I ſhould be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Thus you may ſee even in the very thing wherein he would charge abſurdity upon us, it will return upon himſelf, by putting no difference between the Church of Chriſt, and the Infidel world.</p>
                  <p>He ſayes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>If the Sacrament be a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, there can be no perſonal unworthineſſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to debar any from it, then come Turks, Indians, Papiſts, excommunicate perſons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is but the ſame again in other words,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> which I have anſwered again and again all along: here is a plain levelling the Church with the world again, as if the ſame perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal unworthineſſe were in the Church as is in the world; doth it follow that becauſe no perſonal unworthineſſe in the Church is ſufficient to debar any from the Sacrament, but only actual, perſiſted in unto excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, that therefore there is no perſonal unworthineſſe in the unclean Pagan world, that lies in unbelief? They muſt firſt receive the Doctrine of the Goſpel, before they can be brought into the Church where the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be adminiſtred. And as for thoſe that are in Covenant-relation, and in poſſeſſion of Church-memberſhip, it's true, perſonal unworthineſſe can be no bar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a relative ſenſe, there is no ſuch thing in the Church: but I have ſaid enough to this already.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>If it be a converting Ordinance,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53614:82"/>he can ſee no reaſon why the Communicant ſhould be bound to examine himſelf, and ſo eat, or whether he hath skill to diſcern the Lords body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Word and Prayer are converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> and yet he may ſee reaſon enough to urge upon ſuch, preparation, and caution, prerequiſite and concomitant in thoſe duties of hearing and praying, (if he examine the Scriptures) in order to a bleſſing; the ſame may be ſaid of the Sacrament, if Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> be not too perverſe.</p>
                  <p>But then he comes to ſpeak diſtinctly to the argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He diſtinguiſheth between converting by accident,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or by inſtitution deſigned unto that end, in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancel; hearing of the Word is ſuch, faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>Hear and your ſoul ſhall live, let any ſhew us a Scripture ſpeaking to this purpoſe concerning the Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, faith comes by hearing,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Word of God. But doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that all other Ordinances are excluded from being a means of working ſincere faith in the Church, when they are joyned with the Word in the work of the Miniſtry, as hath been ſaid already? That of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. proves, that it is not poſſible that any ſhould call upon the name of the Lord in whom they have not beleived. And how ſhould they believe in him, of whom they have not (ſo much as) heard of? And how ſhall they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53614:83"/>hear without a Preacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſpoken to the caſe of Heathens that never heard of Chriſt. Such muſt of neceſſity hear Chriſt, before they can believe in him. And this faith comes by hearing, and this hearing by the Word of God, by a Preacher ſent. This was the ordinary means of bringing perſons into the Church, that were Pagans born; and then being within, they had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all other Ordinances in the Church, for their edification and ſalvation. What then, will it follow hence, that perſons born in the Church, that draw in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt by education and tradition in their youth, cannot believe or have faith in any other way but by hearing only? The promiſe is, that <hi>whoſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to thoſe that never heard of his Name. Salvation is of the Chriſtian Church, as once of the <hi>Jews,</hi> unto which promiſe of Salvation all the Ordinances ſet up in the Church are ſubſervient.</p>
                  <p>The work of the Miniſtry was to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on by the Paſtors and Teachers fixed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſeveral flocks in the Church, which they are conſtantly to attend upon for the ſpiritual good thereof; as they which muſt give an account thereof unto their Lord; and it concerns them faithfully to carry on the whole work of their Miniſtry accordingly towards their whole flock, and not to make
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53614:83"/>Heathens of them, &amp; then content themſelves onely with preaching unto them on the Lords day, and the work is done, as if there were no more care to be taken with Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, then with Pagans, nor no more means to be uſed for their ſpiritual good then they would uſe unto Heathen, whom the work of the Miniſtry was never intended for. And whereas Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> cals for proof, <hi>Where are the like Scriptures to prove the Sacrament a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, as is preaching and hearing?</hi> I anſwer him by diſtinguiſhing thus, hearing of faith preached was and is the ordinary means of ſincere believing in the Church, of which the Sacrament is a ſpecial part. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides, the Sacrament cannot be adminiſtred without hearing the Word of God, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with the uſe of other ſenſes, as it is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible compendium of the whole Goſpel hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Chriſt crucified for remiſſion of fins.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak a little unto his other quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. <hi>Hear and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> This was ſpoken unto the Church he will ſay; I grant it was, and more then this too, as that chapter ſhews. That firſt they were invited to come unto God in whom all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſing was to be had, for the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every empty thirſty ſoul; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from thinking to be ſatisfied elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where- Secondly, exhorted unto ſeveral duties.</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53614:84"/>
                  <p n="1">1. To hearken diligently unto what the Lord had ſaid unto them, and be ſatisfied with good.</p>
                  <p>Then 2. incline your ear and come unto me, that you may be ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of my houſe: They were to hear, and come to God too in all holy obedience; for in the Scriptures men are ſaid not to hear, when they will not regard to doe what the Lord hath commanded them, ſo hear that your ſouls may live, hear and doe is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the holy Ghoſt to the Church uſually.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then to ſeek God while he will be found, and to call upon him him while he is neer, ſeek him in all his own appointments and Ordinances, where he hath promiſed his preſence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then is ſubjoyned, <hi>Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; And let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore you may eaſily conceive here is not only hear, and your ſoul ſhall live, but all other duties of worſhip and obſervance are required alſo in the Church, in order to a bleſſing of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, and there are promiſes of grace and mercy unto the Church in that ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon their doing their duties enjoyned: the which doth make good the diſtinction above; We know in the Church, <hi>Not the hearers of the Word, but the doers thereof ſhall be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53614:84"/>bleſied in their deed;</hi> perſons in the Church are bound to obſerve and doe all that Chriſt in his Word hath commanded; upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they have the promiſe of his gracious preſence; and if the Sacrament be an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt for the good of his Church; why may we not exſpect the preſence of Chriſt, in bleſſing this for the ſpiritual good of his Church as all the reſt? Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> muſt give ſtronger reaſons to deny it a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance then theſe, or elſe he had better have ſaid nothing: me thinks Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpie</hi> might have furniſhed him with a greater ſtrength then ſo.</p>
                  <p>Next he ſaith, <hi>Either the Word alone (read at the adminiſtration) is to convert, or Word and ſignes making up the Sacrament; if the Word only, he thinks wicked men may ſtay and hear that, if we ſay more, we muſt prove it.</hi>
                  </p>

And by this time I have given you an account of all that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath excepted againſt the firſt part of my book. I doe not know of any material thing I have omitted to anſwer in particular: but indeed not ſo much for any great cauſe I had thus to doe, in what he hath ſaid to looſen the foundations and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon which my whole building ſtands, but from a deſire further to clear up the thing in controverſie, and to reduce the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie into a narrower compaſſe.</p>

                  <p>Though the right of diſcipline may be inherent in every lawful Presbyter,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> yet the exerciſe thereof is proper only unto thoſe that are intruſted therewith by the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Irregular actings and good ends cannot ſtand together;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> to doe evil that good may come, is not only dangerous but damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of unregeneracy and perſonal unworthineſſe in the Church doth not bar any one from the Sacrament,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> nor doth come within the verge of the Church to judge of or correct in the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Actual unworthineſſe perſiſted in unto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53614:87"/>of perſons in the Church; yet all actual unworthineſſe doth not neceſſarily run perſons upon eating and drinking the Lords Supper unworthily, in the Apoſtles ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>There is no perſonal unworthineſſe in the Church, in a relative ſenſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> in reference to the Sacrament, or any uther Ordinance, but the careleſſe neglect thereof is moſt unworthy and puniſhable.</p>
                  <p>Not to diſcern the Lords Body, is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> not to put a difference between common bread and the inſtituted ſignes, ſet a part by Word and Prayer, to repreſent the death of Chriſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>Examination is a private duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed between God and the conſcience unto a profitable receiving,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> having a ſpecial eye to the rules of the whole adminiſtration, making their approaches there accordingly, externally at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>There is a real difference to be put between the unregenerate Chriſtian,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> and an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Infidel, the Church and the world, believer and unbeliever; the confounding of theſe hath run us into Browniſm of late.</p>
                  <p>The whole Church is in Covenant with God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> and are the immediate objects of the promiſes; but the world lies in wickedneſſe, and under wrath, without the promiſes of the Covenant and hope and God in the world.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:53614:88"/>
                  <p>The whole Church are under all Goſpel obſervance;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> the whole work of the Miniſtry as the ordinary means of their converſion and ſalvation: The Pagan world for the moſt part never had the advantage of ſo much as any part of that work, the Goſpel being hid to them that periſh.</p>
                  <p>Salvation is of the Chriſtian Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> but no ſalvation out of it. <hi>How can they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> And there is ſalvation in no other Name, whatſoever, ſave only in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That the legally unclean were not ſo much debarred the benefit of the Paſſeover,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> as other Sacrifices or ſpiritual obſervances in that Church.</p>
                  <p>That the Moral uncleanneſſe then,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> was no more bar to the Paſſeover, then unto all other obſervances in the Church. Nay that was either puniſhed by the Judges, according unto their Judicial proceedings, or otherwiſe cleanſed from it, by a continual courſe of Sacrifices. And therefore no bar at all againſt any.</p>
                  <p>That no perſons in the Church of the Old Teſtament,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> or in the Churches of the New, read of in Scriptures, were ever debarred the Paſſeover, or the Sacrament of the holy Supper, and allowed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all the other Ordinances in the Church. Hence I cannot but conceive
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53614:88"/>that ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament alone, uſually called the minor Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is but a humane invention in the Church.</p>
                  <p>More is required to the Lords Supper then to Baptiſm in the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> yet leſſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the holy Supper of them that are Church-members, then of Heathens unto Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh of real and relative perſonal worthineſſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> The whole viſible Church not under Church cenſures are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally worthy in a relative ſenſe. And hence there is no perſonal unworthineſſe in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of believing in a large ſenſe, and of believing in a ſtrict ſenſe; both to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted true believers in Scripture ſenſe: The denomination of a Believer is as well derived from a right object believed on, as from the right and holineſſe of the Subject believing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of entring into the Covenant, and of continuing in the Covenant. The former is proper for Infidels: the latter concerns the Church; for it is ſuppoſed that all in the Church have entred the Goſpel Covenant. And in the Church we muſt diſtinguiſh of tranſgreſſing the Covenant, and renouncing the Covenant, of breaking, and renewing it; and whoſoever is entred into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, comes under the whole adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53614:89"/>thereof, and cannot be diſobliged from any obſervance thereof, but by the binding power of the Keys of Chriſts Kingdome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed Juridically.</p>
                  <p>Beloved Friends, I have now given you an account of the moſt of my principles that I build upon, and conclude free admiſſion to the holy Supper from. And I judge they are ſuch that have their riſe from the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or are rational deductions drawn from thence, which are not in the leaſt looſened nor ſhaken by Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> nor any other of his judgement; nor I think never will, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his forwardneſſe of ſpirit in the cloſe of his Book, to cry up a victory, when he has not ſo much as routed me in any one thing in all my Book, which argues a bold conceited vapouring ſpirit a little too much.</p>
                  <p>Therefore now in ſhort, I ſhall collect ſome of his main ſtrength and magiſterial principles made uſe of to undermine the foundations of mine, either expreſt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
                  <p>He denyes that Church-memberſhip alone doth give a full right to the Sacrament,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therefore ſuperaddes knowledge, faith, and the fruits of holineſſe to give one right: all which ſay I is included in Memberſhip. And his ſuperadding will give a Pagan right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He affirms that he looks upon all Church-members habitually worthy from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53614:89"/>in Chriſt, until they diſcover the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by their actual offendings.</p>
                  <p>Then ſay I, he holds, That all Infants are habitually worthy from their intereſt in Chriſt, and commonly fall away from that ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p>He ſayes, 'Tis not much material,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Corinths</hi> were puniſhed for habitual unworthineſſe or no, and yet upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the whole he diſputes againſt.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith the unregenerate are perſonally unworthy, and therefore cannot receive.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſayes there is no promiſe belongs to the unregenerate in the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that have not faith to apply it; and that they are rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the firſt grace, then of the promiſe of that grace; and that the Heathen are as much objects of the promiſes of firſt grace as the unregenerate part of the Church. And doubts whether any promiſe belong to men as unregenerate; if ſo, then Heathen may come to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>He puts no difference between the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in the Church and the Pagan world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> in reſpect of promiſes, titles, duties, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, except it be the baptizing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: he undiſciples them, unduties them, uncovenants them, in reference to the holy Supper, and yet will have them Church-members, and preſent their children unto baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>He ſays,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> That Sacraments are ſtrong
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53614:90"/>meat, which weak Chriſtians are not able to digeſt, and that they are ſeals of faith only.</p>
                  <p>He denyes the Sacrament to be a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> becauſe then Heathens ſhould come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And will not have the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Chriſtians to come under any duty, but what is converting.</p>
                  <p>He affirms that in an unlearned Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> a ſingle Miniſter may ſuſpend from the Sacrament, he being the ruling part of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet in all other thing ſeeme to bear himſelf much upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of men. With ſuch like things as theſe he thinks he hath looſened all that I have built upon, and hence thinks that the whole will fall; but he muſt take a great deal of pains more then yet he hath done, if he think to be the man that muſt give ſatisfaction in this Controverſie. And I believe he muſt ſpeak a great deal more then hath been ſpoken by any, if in the leaſt he can make good ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion from the Sacrament, more then from any other part of holy Communion in ſacred worſhip, I mean of Church-members of years of diſcretion, as the queſtion is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He muſt not think that the authority of men will carry the thing, it being a buſineſſe of this conſequence, that on which the peace and ſettlement depends; which can never be as to our condition, ſo long as men make habitual worthineſſe in a real ſenſe, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53614:90"/>which alone gives one right to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. And ſet up the diſtinction of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever and Infidel in the Church. 3. And level the unregenerate part of the Church with the world in reſpect of Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, promiſes of firſt grace, work of the Miniſtry, feals of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such like interferings in a viſible Church doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, and pluck up the very foundation on which the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſtands. My conſtant prayer to the Lord is, and ſhall be, that he will ſo favour us with the bleſſings of his people, as to give us Magiſtrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that may be tender in protecting and defending the Vine which himſelf hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And it's pity that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> and divers others of his judgement ſhould not ſee where truth and the Churches peace lyes.</p>
                  <p>I have done with him, as to what he hath excepted againſt my Book in particular; I ſhall very briefly examine his ſtrength for Suſpenſion from the Lords Supper.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved Friends, I am ſorry that our Author ſhould take ſuch a deal of pains, to make good that thing that hath, and doth ſo much trouble and hinder the edification and peace of the Church; and hath been the occaſion of the extirpation of the Churches Diſcipline; and the main impediment of an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcipline at the preſent. And how impoſſible it is, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould be preſerved and ſecured in a Church ſtate, from the common reproaches of adverſaries upon his principles, let them
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53614:92"/>that are ſober judge; when himſelf is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the moſt of her members to the Infidel world, diſobliging them from duties of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted worſhip and obſervance, under this pretence, that they are unbelievers, and no diſciples, nor brethren that are within; and hence he will allow them juſt as much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in the Church, as he doth unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; except baptizing their Infants, which he will hardly doe upon their own parents faith, but upon their remote predeceſſors. And thus he makes a great ſtir about ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion from the Sacrament; and by this groundleſſe cenſure, doth hinder or make invalid other neceſſary commands of Jeſus Chriſt, to the great prejudice of the Church of Chriſt; As namely, the benefit of Gods Ordinance of Sacrament, and juſt excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications according to the practice of Apoſtolical Churches, when this ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not known nor heard of. And therefore I having ſpoke ſo much already in defence of this priviledge and and right of a Church-member, and that being already ingaged in this Controverſie, give me leave further to anſwer to what I can finde urged againſt the friends of my judgement that hath not as yet been ſpoken unto, as may ſatisfie the plain minded Chriſtian, that is not able to unravel ſo many ſubtil needleſſe ſyllogiſms, that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> abounds with in his elaborate Book. But I intend bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53614:92"/>And therefore expect not my anſwer unto every thing, but to his main grounds he hath laid for ſuſpenſion.</p>
                  <p>In ſtating of the queſtion Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſayes;</p>

                     <hi>As to ſuſpending of ſome perſons from the Supper; he means no more then a denyal of that Ordinance from ſome,</hi> pag. 1.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak unto that ſuſpenſion he cals Juridical and Poſitive only;

                  <p>Here you may take notice, how clear Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> is in ſtating the queſtion.</p>

                  <p>And then ſecondly the Church declares they have no Communion with them: ſo that he in ſtating the queſtion layes foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a Suſpenſion, and Excommunication both: For if excommunidation conſiſts not in putting out of all Church Communion, I know not what it is. He ſo confounds theſe, that I know not how to take him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I muſt query him a little further about the queſtion ſtated.</p>
                  <p>I query whether a Miniſter with his Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Lay Elders be a Presbytery that can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend their members Juridically.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I judge this but the ſame with a Paſtor denying the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament at his private will and pleaſure. Such Elders have no more to do with the exerciſe of diſcipline then with the adminiſtrations of all publique worſhip. They have not ſo much as a name, nor the lineaments of an Office known in Scripture. And it is a buſineſſe of the like difficulty to prove lay rulere in the Church, diſtinct from Miniſterial rulers, as to prove Juridicall Suſpenſion from the Sacrament only diſtinct from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</p>
                  <p>I query whether in ſuſpending of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from the Sacrament,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their proceedings be according to that known rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how they can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that rule unto the ignorant, that are not ſcandalous, they may doe well to tell us.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:53614:93"/>
                  <p>I query what difference they make between a Juridical ſuſpended member,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and thoſe that keep away out of careleſneſſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of their proceeding in order unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
                  <p>I query again in what relation doth a ſuſpended member ſtand in reference unto holy Communion in the other parts of Gods worſhip.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Has he a Communion with you as a Church-member, upon the account of his duty and Church priviledge, or as you will allow the preſence of a Heathen in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to converſion?</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, but as a Heathen, whom you will allow the benefit of converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in the Church; then your ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the ſame with excommunication; for you allow an excommunicate perſon as much benefit of converting Ordinances as a Heathen.

                  <p>If in the third place you ſay, The Church declares ſhe will have no Communion with ſuch in the Sacrament as a member onely; limiting her none Communion to that,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53614:94"/>and from no other holy Communion in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as a member, then you will make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in acts of worſhip, which are all acts of holy Communion, and make a ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be not a ſufficient title to claim the benefit of a Sacrament, as I have ſtated it, cleared and proved it, we ſhould rather begin the reforming of our Church at mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip (if we can tell how) then at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the Sacrament being the undoubted right of every Church-member. If ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion put perſons out of all Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in acts of holy worſhip, then they are conſidered as in the ſtate of Heathens, which is all one with excommunication. And therefore Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath taken a great deal of pains to prove I know not what, unleſſe it be excommunication under the name of Juridical ſuſpenſion, and then what will become of ſuſpenſion? it will fall of it's own accord without any further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53614:94"/>as ſuſpenſion, diſtinct from excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then we ſhould finde ſomething of it in the Scriptures: And in what caſes it ſhould be exerciſed; if it be a leſſer cenſure, then in reaſon we ſhould have ſome hints from Scriptures, for what ſins, or for what want of qualifications prerequiſite unto the Sacrament more then any other Ordinance of Worſhip. Now Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſaith, <hi>If he can but prove it in any caſe how ignorant, heretical or ſcandalous ſoever,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 4. <hi>Mr.</hi> Botemans <hi>challenge will be anſwered.</hi> True, but that ſtill remains to doe; and if Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> fail in the ſtating of the queſtion, it's ten to one he is at as great a loſſe in his proof.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I will ſuppoſe, that that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion which Mr. <hi>Boteman</hi> would have proved, is this, that a Miniſter with his two Elders have power, in the Name of Chriſt to deny the Sacrament to thoſe that are Church-members and in poſſeſſion of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and allow them the priviledge of all the other Ordinances of Worſhip and Communion in the Church, as members of the ſame Church. And I believe Mr. <hi>Boteman</hi> and I ſhall never ſee nor hear that ſuſpenſion proved by any whatever, from the Scriptures. And I think that the thing he endeavours to prove: either he means this, or elſe the ſame with excommunication, if he wil allow them no other Communion with the Church then unto Heathens.</p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:53614:95"/>
                  <p>Now I come to examine his proof: and his principal examination is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To thoſe whom the Sacrament may not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be given, it may lawfully be denyed. But there be ſome baptized perſons in the Church, to whom it may not lawfully be given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Major is granted,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> let us ſee how he can prove his Minor; Namely, that there are or may be ſome baptized perſons not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate to whom the Sacrament may not lawfully be given. His firſt proof of this is <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Give not that which is holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Dogs, neither caſt you your pearls before Swine, leſt they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.</hi> He is a great deal more large upon this proof, then he is profitable or pertinent to the buſineſſe: I ſhall endt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour firſt to give the ſenſe; and then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the main of his, for he is too large for me to tranſcribe.</p>
                  <p>I conceive then, That this Text of our bleſſed Saviour is chiefly ſpoken by way of counſel and caution unto his Diſciples and followers in general, reſpecting all that were then preſent hearers of him at his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon the Mount, that gave credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Doctrine, and acknowledged his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and whereas he would not have them give that which is holy to the dogs, he means private reproofs and admonitions; becauſe thoſe were perillous times in regard of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53614:95"/>cruel carping In fidel <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> that were ſuch deadly enemies unto him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that ſhould ſpeak on his behalf: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reference to the ſafety of their perſons, he warrants their ſilence, rather then to put their perſons upon ſuch imminent danger of being rent by that untoward generation of malicious enemies of Chriſt; and eſpecially, Chriſt knowing that they were given up to a ſpirit of blindeneſſe and hardneſſe of heart, that they ſhould not repent; and therefore whatever Pearls of Divine Truth were caſt unto them for their good, were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they would but ſlight and ſcorn them, and trample them under their feet; ſo that the reaſon is double, why he warrants their filence to ſuch dogs; not only the ſafety of their perſons, but the unprofitableneſſe of their reproofs and holy admonitions; they will but trample them under feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Good reaſon had our bleſſed Saviour thus to caution his Diſciples; for, if I miſtake not, Chriſt himſelf not long before was led by ſuch kind of wretched people, unto the brow of a hill, thinking to have thrown him down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; but by a divine power eſcaped through the midſt of them. If you compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. with <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 'tis probable that it was before this Sermon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was meant of private admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reproof, is clear, becauſe it was before the twelve were ſo much as all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53614:96"/>called, much leſſe ſent publickly to preach.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be meant of publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in the Church of Chriſt, becauſe then the old adminiſtrations were in form, which all were injoyned to obſerve; And the new adminiſtrations were not then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It could not be meant of the Lords Supper, becauſe it was not inſtituted then, nor of two or three years after; therefore thoſe whom he preacht unto, and meant by the word <hi>yea,</hi> could not be in a capacity to give that holy thing at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By Dogs and Swine cannot be meant Diſciples, and thoſe that were followers and adherers unto Chriſt, for to them is this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and moderate merciful caution given. I do not deny, but this place is applyable unto all times in the Church upon the ſame or like reaſon and occaſion, but I think this place is nothing at all to the Controverſie in hand, for I know of none that will plead for the admiſſion of ſuch that will rent you for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the holy Supper. And as that is no reaſon why they ſhould deny it to ours, ſo not the ſenſe of the place, as by dogs were not meant profeſſors and followers of Chriſt then, ſo not now; but by dogs muſt needs be underſtood cruel perſecutors of Chriſt &amp; the truth of precious doctrine that he taught, and was believed by many. And therefore when he firſt ſent forth his Diſciples to preach the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53614:96"/>Kingdome of heaven only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Chriſt gives them the like counſel, <hi>Behold,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> I ſend you as Sheep among Wolves, be ye therefore wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Doves. And when they perſecute you in one City, flee to another. And ſhake the duſt off your feet againſt thoſe that will not receive you:</hi> but are ready rather to rent you. You ſee our bleſſed Saviour compares the unbelieving Jews, Scribes and Phariſees, and Prieſts unto Wolves, which are a kinde of wilde dogs: the which ſtrengthens the ſenſe I have given. Tell me where the Prophets or Apoſtles are forbid to warn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, admoniſh the Church (though never ſo corrupt) in their publick diſpenſations, or forbid to adminiſter the holy Sacraments unto them; from the like reaſons as in the Text. The Prophets were to give warning, and tell the people of their ſins, and of Gods judgements for their ſins, the Paſtors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their ſeveral flocks are to feed the flock of God, and to teach them all obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances preſcribed by their Lord. And ſee that their people know, obſerve, and doe all things that Chriſt commands, ruling over them as the heritage of their Lord, and not as if they were of <hi>Belial,</hi> Dogs and Swine, whom they may ſhut out of doores, and ſtarve them at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Having given this ſenſe, which I doubt not but is nearer the mark, and leſſe lyable unto exceptions then Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> his ſenſe will
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53614:97"/>appear to be. And is applyable to men of reproveable ſpirits now, and in the Church too unto private Chriſtians, that upon their neceſſary journey, or otherwiſe may poſſibly meet with ſuch that will not bear reproofs, be it performed with never ſuch wiſdom, but will either fly in the face, or reproach and ſcorn their reprover. In ſuch like caſes, Chriſt doth warrant his peoples ſilence. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr. <hi>Beteman</hi> hath done well upon this text; and although it were not very civil for Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> to print his brothers Sermon without his conſent, and that at ſecond hand too, himſelf not hearing it at all. Yet I doubt not but his printing of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hath done much in taking off, what he ſo freely aſperſes and reproacheth him with, in his long narrative preface.</p>
                  <p>But in ſuch caſes as before the Church, (were ſhe in a capacity) might uſe her power to reform ſuch rayling dogged offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> queries 1. What is meant by that which is holy, which was forbid to be given.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who are the Dogs and Swine here ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To whom this precept is directed.</p>
                  <p>His anſwer to the firſt is, That all holy things and pearls are here forbid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Scripture doth not elſewhere plainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be given unto Dogs and Swine.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:53614:97"/>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſayes he hopes it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be granted to concern ſuch holy things as God hath betruſted us Miniſters to give out: His reaſon is, <hi>For is is to men Chriſt ſpakes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How can Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> be aſſured,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> that all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are here meant, when Chriſt ſaith only to private men that he preacht unto; Give not that which is holy unto the dogs? Were private hearers in a capacity to give all holy things? This interp retation will pleaſe ſome men in theſe exorbitant times, that put no difference between perſons in the Office and Function of the Miniſtry, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gifted men.</p>
                  <p>Private reproofs, inſtructions,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is that which is holy, and anſwers the Word, for Chriſt doth not ſay, give not all holy things (ſpeaking in the plural number) as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> doth; nor doth he ſay, give not that which ſhall be holy hereafter unto the dogs, within my Church, as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> would have it, but he ſaith, Give not that which is holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpeaking in the preſent tenſe; and then judge whether the holy Supper be here meant, that was not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, nor propheſied of. Nay, ſee how our Author is intoxicated with his own fancy, that he fetches firſt ſuch a compaſſe to include it in; and then ſo narrows the text again, that he excludes all other holy things out of it, and will allow no other thing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53614:98"/>to be meant but the holy Supper only, which is not to be given unto dogs, ſaith he; this is a fine fetch to prove ſuſpenſion indeed, if it would hold, 'tis certain the Sacrament was not ſpoken of in this text at all.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he ſaith,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>He hopes it will be granted him, that the text concerns all ſuch holy things as are betruſted unto Miniſters by God himſelf; for it is men that Chriſt ſpeaks unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See his reaſon,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> we muſt grant him that the text concerns all holy things which Miniſters are intruſted with to diſpenſe, becauſe they were men that Chriſt ſpoke to, as if all men were intruſted with publike Ordinances. And he cannot prove that any of his hearers were in Office to diſpenſe holy things; if he could he would have ſaid Miniſters for men, but I ſhall proceed and come to his ſecond query, <hi>What is meant by Dogs and Swine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His anſwer to this is ſomething large, in giving the opinion of the learned; but I ſhall not meddle with his authorities; but to what himſelf ſaith in his 15, 16. pages, wherein he ſhews, that the Scriptures call ſome men dogs in ſeveral reſpects; but I ſhall only examine thoſe which concern the argument in hand, namely, who are Dogs and Swine in the Church of Chriſt, whom Miniſters are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to give the Sacrament unto, and allow them the benefit of all the other Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>To his 1, 2, 3. account, let the indifferent reader look unto his quotations, and he will
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53614:98"/>be ſatisfied, that they concern not the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hand.</p>
                  <p>His 4. is, <hi>Wicked men both in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Prov.</hi> 26.11. <hi>and in the New,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>are called dogs, becauſe as the dog filthily licks up his vomit again,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That of <hi>Solomon</hi> is this,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> 
                     <hi>As a dog returns to his vomit, ſo a fool returns to his folly.</hi> Every fool is not a wicked man, yet every wicked man is a fool in Scripture ſenſe I think: but it doth not follow, that every wicked grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe man is a dog, though he may have ſome properties like the properties of a dog, but this is a different property from that in the text, and nothing to the purpoſe. That of <hi>Peter</hi> is meant of Apoſtates, falling from the Truth and profeſſion of faith once embraced, like thoſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> propheſies of, <hi>men ſhall ariſe from among your ſelves, ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things, and ſhall draw diſciples after them,</hi> ſuch as theſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, that turn from the Truth unto Error, and upon that account take upon them to be Teachers, that they may vent their damnable hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo fall away from the true Church, either to their former vomit of Heatheniſm, or to wallow in the mire of their former ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality; ſuch need not to be ſuſpended, that fall off from the Church of themſelves. This will not reach the argument in hand as to our caſe.</p>
                  <p>His 5. is, <hi>Heathens are called dogs, Mat.</hi> 7.27.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53614:99"/>and we will yeild the argument ſo far.</p>
                  <p>His laſt is, <hi>Sinners in general are called dogs,</hi> Phil. 3.2. Beware of dogs, <hi>where he means falſe teachers, rightly called dogs, ſaith</hi> Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</p>
                  <p>This is fine,

                     </gap> by reverend <hi>Muſculus;</hi> and yet this he quotes to prove that ſinners in general are called dogs.

                  <p>Let Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſhew us ſome Scriptures to prove that Church-members, diſciples or any one that is called a brother, and within, that is an object of Church-cenſures, is any where called a dog.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53614:99"/>ſinner under excommunication to be a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (for ſo he takes that quotation) then he hath little reaſon to count a member un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the indulgence of the Church a dog, or a ſwine. The truth is, he is ſo miſerably out, I think he did not know what he writ; and he had need have a better head then mine to bring all his ends together in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are ſo wide one from another; and the Church and World ſo confounded into one, that I cannot tell what to make of him; <hi>For if we ſay,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that by dogs are meant the Heathen, as Mark.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Then either thoſe only, or thoſe amongſt others.</hi> (2). <hi>If we ſay the latter, then they yeeld it.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This counſel is directed unto the whole Church or Brotherhood touching their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others, that were Perſecutors and fierce dogged enemies to the Chriſtian profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion; and is not at all applyable to perſons in the Church, in reſpect of publick admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, the which all in the Church are commanded to obſerve; nor is our Saviours reaſon of any force for any in the Church, (leſt they turn again and rent you) nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to the publike Ordinances; for there is not any that will rent you for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring unto them the Word, Sacrament, and prayer, in the Church; if any will doe ſo, let the Church judge them for it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I grant that by dogs is meant cruel perſecutors, that at any time ſhall rent and ruine the perſons of thoſe that profeſſe the true Chriſtian Religion. And this may be done by ſome that are not Heathens, for there are many miſ-believers and falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that where they are backt with power, (as in the Papacy) are cruel dogs againſt the Profeſſors of the true Religion: but yet it does not follow, that any that profeeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves members of our Church are the dogs
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53614:100"/>meant in the text. It's true, we have had our differences amongſt our ſelves, about ſome circumſtances and inconvenient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, about the ordering of Worſhip. And our firſt Reformers put us in a way for diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, confirmed by the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Nation. And thoſe that had the exerciſe of the Churches diſcipline, have been ſevere in puniſhing thoſe that have not been obedient unto her commands; and we know they abuſed their power in ſome caſes too much, under the pretence of ſingular good ends: Namely, the order, peace, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and edification of the whole, to prevent the common miſchief of factions, ſchiſin, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, erroneous doctrine, and the like, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, in a Church theſe evils will abound. Now I ſay, it is not very handſome for Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> that profeſſes himſelf a younger ſon of the Church, to account the Rulers of our Church Perſecutors; much leſſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people for adhering unto their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Teachers: as they ſhall have better Rulers, and Teachers, I queſtion not but we ſhall finde them better diſpoſed; how ever this is a far different caſe to the cruel unbelieving <hi>Jewes,</hi> and Hereticall bloudy Papiſts, and yet neither of them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I affirm, That as all other Scripture, ſo this, in ſpecial, is written for our learning and uſe; and it alwayes holds in the ſame,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53614:101"/>or like caſes, or reaſon. Whether unto the deſperate irreproveable Ruffian in the Church, or of the bloudy Perſecutors out of the Church, Jews, Turks, or Papiſts: and yet I ſay alſo, that whomſoever upon taſting of them, we finde them of peaceable ſpirits, whether they be in the Church or out of the Church, we ſhould reprove, inſtruct, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and warn every ſinner, to flye the wrath to come: And this we ought to doe towards all, in our places and callings as private Chriſtians. And hence I conceive that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> is hugely miſtaken, that ſtretcheth the metaphor of dogs, to any kinde of ſinners that the Scriptures compare to dogs, for other kinde of properties of dogs, as worthleſneſſe, greedineſſe, barking, or licking up their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the text is of ſuch dogs that will tear and ſcorn you for the beſt counſel you can give them for the good of their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>And me thinks, that the ſame ground Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> goes upon to allow all the other holy things unto Heathens, the Excomunicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might ſatisfie him, as rationally to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Sacrament unto the ignorant and ſcandalous in the Church: all that he pleads to the other is from ſome other Scripture warrant; and I appeal unto the Impartial to judge between us, whether Paſtors and Teachers of their reſpective flocks, be not as much bound by Chriſts command to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the holy Supper unto their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53614:101"/>flocks, conſiſting of Church-members, diſciples, baptized and not excommunicated, as to adminiſter the other holy Ordinances unto Heathen, the Excommunicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think I have ſaid enough as to the former from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. to give full ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Let me tell our Author and the world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that although it be ſufficiently taught in the holy Sciptures to deny the unbaptized and Excommunicate the holy Supper; yet this text in debate doth not forbid it at all to thoſe that are without, or under Church cenſures; much leſſe doth it forbid the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to thoſe that are within, which is the thing Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> quotes it to prove. And thus in ſhort I have anſwered to the main of Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſtrength, as touching this place. And I humbly conceive have broke his argument drawn from this text to make good his principal Syllogiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. That there may be ſome baptized perſons in the Church, not caſt out, to whom the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not lawfully be given. And he muſt quit himſelf a great deal better (then in his book) to make good his two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from this text, before he can conclude any thing for his purpoſe. And truly I think it was an acceptable ſervice (both to God and the poor Church) in Mr. <hi>Boteman,</hi> who ſo preſently addreſt himſelf to redeem a captive text, ſo wofully wreſted to perplex and diſturb the poor Churches peace, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>And for his aſſumption, That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a holy thing, and a Pearl; and there may be ſome in the Church not caſt out, who in Scripture phraſe are Dogs and Swine. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's true,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> the Sacrament is a holy thing; but it doth not therefore follow, that it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If any perſons in the Church be objects of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I judge ſuch are; and then judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Suſpenſion be ſufficient, where Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication ſhould and ought to take place, provided they be obſtinate: otherwiſe Church admonition may be a ſufficient remedy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch ſcandalous ſinners. Hence judge
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53614:102"/>how pertinent this text is made uſe of to prove ſuſpenſion of ſome from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as members of the Church may be allowed Communion with the Church, in all other ſpiritual acts of worſhip! How this proves Suſpenſion of ſome diſtinct from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, I leave to the freedome of your own Judgements to judge of.</p>
                  <p>In the next place (without any wrong to the Author) I ſhall examine his third Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture argument deducible from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. rather chooſing to follow the Apoſtles order in this Epiſtle, becauſe by anſwering of this firſt, it will ſave me ſome labour in my anſwer to his ſecond, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17.</p>
                  <p>His Argument is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is unlawfull for the Officers of the Church to give the Sacrament to ſuch with whom it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for themſelves or their brethren to eat.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But there may be ſome in the Church not caſt out, with whom it may be unlawful for the Church to eat.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I queſtion the truth of his firſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> by diſtinguiſhing of a friendly fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unneceſſary eating, and of a true ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary eating. Now in a civil ſenſe, I may not have friendly unneceſſary familiarity with ſcandalous brethren, though not caſt out, but may withdraw from all friendly unneceſſary familiarity from ſuch, as a means to bring them to ſhame; but it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53614:103"/>does not follow therefore, that I upon my neceſſary occaſions in my Calling muſt ſhun ſuch, but that I may ſet ſuch a one a work, and admit him to my Table he being not caſt out, though ſcandalous, or a poor man may work for a ſcandalous rich man, and eat at his Table with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or upon a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and divers ſuch caſes, with relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the ſame perſons that I may not eat with, the ſame perſons I may eat with, ſo that if the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. mean but civill eating, his firſt propoſition is not good, nor very clear, which he would have his Reader to believe without any doubt, or proof.</p>
                  <p>If we may eat with a ſcandalous brother not legally caſt out as before,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> then we may have company, and eat with ſuch at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe giving and receiving at the Sacrament is our neceſſary duty as profeſſing Chriſtians, and Church-members, which I have ſufficiently proved before; the which the worſt offenders in the Church may not careleſſely neglect, ſo long as they are in a Church capacity to receive, and that capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remains untill the Church authoritatively have put them out of Church Communion as Members. And then, and not until then, are ſcandalous brethren, diſobliged from publick duties of worſhip: and hence his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that he draws from the leſſer to the greater is fallacious: and that muſt needs be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53614:103"/>the bottome of his argument: For there is but few Interpreters otherwayes expound it, but of a civil eating. And himſelf ſeems moſt confident in that argument in its place. And therefore he ſhould have proved his main propoſition; namely, That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to give the Sacrament to thoſe in the Church not Excommunicate, with whom in ſome caſes it is unlawful to eat in a civil ſenſe. And for to take it, for not to eat at the Sacrament only properly, as it's too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to prove, ſo it would follow, that he will prove the ſame, by the ſame; for then the ſenſe of his propoſition is this: That it is unlawful to give the Sacrament unto ſuch that we may not give the Sacrament unto: but there is ſome not caſt out we may not give the Sacrament unto. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take his argument in what ſenſe you can, there is nothing in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. to ſtand upon, or in the leaſt to make it good: his proof of his Minor fals too ſhort.</p>
                  <p>I will grant him, 1. That there may be ſuch in the Church, that the Apoſtle cals old leaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is unlawful for the Church to connive at their wickedneſſe, that was that old leaven, and keep the Feaſt of the Lords Supper with them: but what's this for his purpoſe? himſelf ſaith it's a plain caſe, that the Apoſtle did chide the <hi>Corinths,</hi> in that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53614:104"/>they did not caſt out the inceſtuous perſon, that leavened their Communion, by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. in this he ſayes true, and they of <hi>Corinth</hi> put this Decree into executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning the inceſtuous perſon, as the only remedy to purge themſelves of that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that ſowred the whole, by their conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence and ſinful indulgence. What then? Does it follow becauſe they were chidden for their neglect of exerciſing Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, therefore they were chidden for admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacrament unto him before he was Juridically put out of all Communion with them? If the Apoſtle had underſtood that ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament only, had been a ſufficient remedy to purge the Church, and reform the ſinner, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he would have blamed them for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to the Sacrament, and he would have given the remedy in preſcribing a rule to ſuſpend him from the Sacrament only: but as their whole Communion was leavened by their ſinful indulgence, ſo they were urged to caſt that ſcandalous perſon out of all Chriſtian Communion, ſacred and civil, <hi>with ſuch a one, no not eat;</hi> but how doth this prove, that there may be ſome in the Church not excommunicated, with whom it's unlawfull to eat the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p>But he goes on with his proof of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing. <hi>That it is not lawful to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53614:104"/>with ſcandalous ſinners, let us therefore keep the Feaſt, not with the old leaven of malice and wickedneſse: from hence is eaſily gathered,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Chriſtians ought not to keep the feaſt with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True, I ſay ſo too,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> where a Church is in a capacity to deal with the ſcandalous Juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and thereby put them out of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion, as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>But I deny ſtill,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that they were blamed for admitting ſuch unto Gods Ordinances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were Juridically by the cenſures of the Church ſeparated from the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Search and ſee if you can finde one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of a ſentence in this chapter tending that way.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> makes a great deal of doe about keeping the Feaſt, but at laſt I think he faſtens upon a good honeſt ſafe interpretation, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.6. <hi>Where the Lord promiſeth to make a feaſt of fat things unto all people, Gentiles, as well as Jews; by which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is promiſed all Goſpel Ordinances, and a holy Communion with them, in all his Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and hence the Sacrament is a part of this Feaſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</p>
                  <p>But if that be the ſenſe,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> then upon his own confeſſion the Sacrament is but a part of that Feaſt; Why, how doth this prove then, that we ought not to keep the Feaſt with ſcandalous ſinners, when Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53614:105"/>ſcandalous ſinners the liberty of all the other diſhes and parts of this Feaſt: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aware of this, he addes, that the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Supper is the only proper Feaſt of this Feaſt, that's his ſenſe; firſt he will be honeſt, and let every Goſpel Ordinance have a ſhare in this Feaſt, and then attributes all to this one, and makes it the proper Feaſt of the Feaſt they was to keep. And he tels us, <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it muſt be ſo, becauſe ſome Communion with on inceſtuous perſon in other Ordinances may be allowed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, let the Scripture ſay what it will; and although Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> is forced to confeſſe his aſſent unto a rational ſenſe, you may ſee how his private opinion and fancy draws him off again, and makes him venture to give the denomination of this Feaſt to the Lords Supper only; and it muſt be ſo, becauſe againſt his own reaſon and ſenſe he will have it ſo; is that a reaſon to make it good, for ſome Communion with an inceſtuous perſon in other Ordinances may be allowed, directly contrary to the Apoſtles decree, and direction, when he commands them, To put out from amongſt your ſelves that wicked perſon, verſe the laſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill the very main thing of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wants proof, That there may be ſome in the Church, not Excommunicate, with whom it is unlawful for the Church to eat.</p>
                  <p>In his proof of this, he muſt make good theſe ſeveral things.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:53614:105"/>
                  <p>That in this 5.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> chap. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> the Church was blamed for eating with the ſcandalous brother before the Churches tryal and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Excommunication was inflicted.</p>
                  <p>That the Church was not leavened for their careleſſe connivence,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and tolerating ſuch a ſcandalous brother, but only for admitting of him to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>That the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had done their duty,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if they had only ſuſpended him from the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>That we are as much forbid the company and civil friendly familiarity in eating and drinking with a ſcandalous brother not caſt out, as with an Excommunicate perſon.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhal refer my ſelf to thoſe that are learned &amp; ſober, if it be not of neceſſity to prove thoſe things, before he can conclude from this Chapter, that there may be ſome in the Church not caſt out, with whom it may be unlawful to eat the Sacrament, or that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excommunicate members ſhould be ſuſpended from the Sacrament, and allowed the liberty of all other Ordinances in the Church as members.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> in ſtead of making good his Argument, he trifles about making that word Feaſt, to be meant only the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after he hath granted it was but a part thereof, as it is one Ordinance with the other of Goſpel Worſhip. He quotes Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy,</hi> that tels us this Feaſt cannot be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53614:106"/>reſtrained unto the Lords Supper only. And Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> that underſtands it of Church Communion in the dainties of the Goſpel. And <hi>Ravenella,</hi> that ſayes it is taken for all Goſpel Worſhip, from <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.16, 17, 18. and yet he will goe beyond his own Authors, and prove with reaſon beyond them all, that by this Feaſt is meant the Sacrament on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe I had thought (to prevent tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe) to have paſt by his reaſons; but leſt he ſhould be wiſe in his own conceit, I ſhall take ſome notice of them.</p>
                  <p>All he ſayes amounts to this, ſurely it were not a civil Feaſt, nor a <hi>Moſaical</hi> Feaſt, but meant of ſome ſpiritual Goſpel Feaſt; and the Supper is a part of the Goſpel Feaſt, the relation the text hath to the Paſſeover, and the liberty of Communion with an ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous perſon in the other Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is he ſure that all <hi>Moſaical</hi> Feaſts were then out of uſe?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That their Feaſts of Charity may have no reference to this Feaſt? <hi>Jude</hi> tels us, that ſcandalous looſe heretical perſons in the Church were ſpots in their Feaſts of Charity. And this ſcandalous perſon is ſaid to leaven them, and nothing more oppoſite to their Feaſts of Charity then to feaſt together with malice and wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is there no difference to be put between that one Sacrifice of Chriſt himſelf once for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53614:106"/>all, and the Paſchal Lambe an outward ſign thereof, that the Apoſtles analogie muſt needs be reſtrained unto the Sacrament ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding? The reſt have been anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Let him prove that the Sacrament is any where called a Feaſt: it doth not become him to give Jeſus Chriſt a nick name.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe for my own part, I moſt incline to thoſe that underſtand by keeping holy Communion in the Profeſſion of the Goſpel thoughout the whole courſe of our lives, not denying but that the Sacrament is involved in this General of a holy life.</p>
                  <p>And my reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles motive thus to keep the Feaſt, holds unto all holy duties,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and to all times: for Chriſt is always our Paſſeover that was ſacrificed for the Church.</p>
                  <p>We have alwayes cauſe of purging out the old leaven out of our own hearts and lives,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and purging of our ſelves from all ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence and indulging of ſcandalous brethren that leaven the whole, when Church diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is careleſſely out of coldneſſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                  <p>The rule or remedy preſcribed in the text,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as touching ſcandalous offenders to amend them, is upon that particular occaſion, drawn out into a general that holds always, as I ſhall make good in anſwer unto his next argument drawn from this text.</p>
                  <p>But what if I ſhould grant him what he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53614:107"/>can never prove that by Feaſt is meant the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament only, will it follow that ſcandalous brethren muſt only be left out, or barely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Sacrament only, when the Apoſtle chides the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for not grieving it ſo, as to provoke them unto zeal, to put away that perſon from among them, verſ. 2. Beſides, if ſuch ſcandalous ſinners in the Church, as the Apoſtle reckons up ver. 11. ought not to be excommunicate, then not any at all, and is it ſafe for the Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch the Sacrament only, whom they ought to Excommunicate and put out of all Communion whatſoever? Suppoſe the Church had done no more, but put that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon from the Sacrament, doe you think they had put that Apoſtolical ſentence into execution, verſ. 4.5. Let him prove that ever any Church in the Apoſtles age ſuſpended their members from the Sacrament only, as he would have it. The truth is, he affects to draw up many ſyllogiſms, but he is not able to prove any one of them. I could wiſh he would either ſtudy his things better, or elſe give over his writing about this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>

                     <hi>If there be ſome in the Church not yet caſt out by Excommunication, who are Fornicators, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, or Idolaters, or Raylers, or Drunkards, or Extortioners, then there may be ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For 1. the proof of his major doth not ſay that in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> there were ſuch.

                  <p>Suppoſe that there be ſuch in a true Church,

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53614:108"/>guilty of ſuch and ſuch ſcandalous ſins at any time in the Church, the Church ought to judge them by putting them out of all Communion, as in that particular caſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt. If ſuch as the Apoſtle nominates for ſcandalous brethren be not objects of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, not only my ſelf but all reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches in Chriſtendome are hugely out. Can any have the leaſt ſhew of reaſon to conceive, that the Apoſtle ſhould be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt an inceſtuous perſon, and the Church for not putting him away from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, verſ. 2. and ſay nothing to their conniving and indulging an Adulterer, Idolater, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That were then ſuch guilty perſons known amongſt them, as he for inceſt; or that ſuppoſe there were ſuch, can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they were ſuſpended from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only, as a ſufficient puniſhment for thoſe ſins, as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> would; And ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the matter loſe this Ordinance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, except it be for inceſt? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friends, I beſeech you mark the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles order and ſcope, and you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his ſenſe; he had wrote an Epiſtle unto them before, not to company with forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, covetous, Extortioners, or Idolaters of the world, but upon this occaſion of a members miſcarriage in the Church, in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle he mollifies with lenity his former Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and tels them now, yet not altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear company with ſuch &amp; ſuch of the world,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53614:108"/>for then you muſt goe out of the world, but now I have written unto you, not to keep company, not to eat, upon another ſtricter account, if a Brother be ſuch a one as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel Pagan is, put them out of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion altogether. And thus he drawes out a general rule from this particular caſe of the inceſtuous perſon; leaving the Infidel world to the judgement of God, but ſets up a judging in the Church for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that ſcandalous Brethren may be reformed, and their ſouls ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus; as I have ſpoke already. And if I miſtake not, Reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, upon the ſame place, in his 12. chap. 4. book. 5. Section <hi>Of his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Upon the ſecond end of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis true, he ſayes, in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Supper choiſe is greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, which yet (ſaith he) cannot be had but by the Juriſdiction of the Church. Then in the ſecond end, leaſt (as it is wont to come to paſſe) with the continual company of the evill, the good ſhould be corrupted. This end the Apoſtle touched, when he commanded the <hi>Corinths</hi> to put the inceſtuous perſon out of their company. A little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (ſaith he) corrupts the whole. And he foreſaw herein ſo great a danger that he forbad him all fellowſhip, and ſo applyes the 11. verſe to the ſame with the inceſtuous perſon. If any Brother be either a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53614:109"/>or an Idolater, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſuch a one I grant you not leave, ſo much as to eat. Therefore you may clearly conceive that <hi>Calvin</hi> applyes that particular inſtance to be ſpoke of all other, the Apoſtle names in the 11. verſe: this Reverend Author would have none debarred the Sacrament, but by the Juriſdiction of the Church, nor have any Excommunicate for leſſer ſins, when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of words authoritatively will amend them: but when they grievouſly offend the Church; they ought for a time to be deprived of the Communion of the Supper, till they have given aſſurance of their repentance; his ground is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. thus explaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for againſt the <hi>Corinthian Paul</hi> uſeth not only rebuking of words, but driveth him out of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What's this but Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication? and yet Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> quotes this very place to prove ſuſpenſion diſtinct from Excommunication in his <hi>pag.</hi> 140, 141. If he deal thus with his authority, he makes ſuch a noyſe withall, no wonder they be not all of his opinion. Then he quotes <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> which I deſire in brief to to give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, he concludes that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> is for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he makes Excommunication the laſt remedy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe he hath given fourteen reaſons to prove that ſcandalous perſons ought to be kept from the holy Supper.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:53614:109"/>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath not a word of ſuſpenſion.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Muſt the laſt remedy neceſſarily imply ſuſpenſion, why not ſeverity of words, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publike admonition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to his ſecond, he gives fourteen arguments to prove that the Power of the Keys is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the Church. And Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> tels his Reader they are to keep the ſcandalous from the Sacrament: but he deals with his Author as he doth with Scriptures. But as touching this Reverend Author, for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He admits of no other proceedings in the diſcipline of the Church, but according to that known rule <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. and that in all caſes of ſcandal and open ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not to proceed unto Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in point of obſtinacy perſiſted in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He defines Excommunication to be the baniſhing of a grievous tranſgreſſor, or an open ungodly and obſtinate perſon from the fellowſhip of the faithful, by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Elders, and conſent of the Church, and by the Authority of Chriſt, and by the holy Scriptures, and then ſayes, when the Church pronounceth of any that they are not godly, they muſt be excommunicated, and not admitted unto the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his 5. queſtion upon the <hi>Keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Thus you may conceive this quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his, directly proves that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53614:110"/>is that which debars ſcandalous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the Sacrament, and not ſuſpenſion, as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> would falſely have it be.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Reader may eaſily judge what foundation Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath deducted his argument from: he firſt miſtakes the text, and then rayſes his argument; and thus he hath built a Caſtle in the ayr. And before he can conclude any thing to ſuſpend ſcandalous brethren from the Sacrament, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. he muſt prove that thoſe that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, were not Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or that he ſpeaks to the caſe of ſcandalous brethren in the Church, in the want of Church Diſcipline. I muſt confeſſe with grief of heart, that his Minor is true, that there are ſuch ſcandalous ſinners in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

A difference muſt be made between a Brother under Church toleration, and a brother under Church Excommunication, or elſe Church cenſures are meerly ſuperfluous; and to n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that his diſpute about not keep company, not to eat, with ſcandalous Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren not Excommunicate, is nothing at all
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53614:110"/>to the Text, nor to his Argument, for we are all agreed in this, that the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſon may not come to the Sacrament, nor during that cenſure, may we keep company, and as <hi>Calvin</hi> renders it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would not grant them leave ſo much as to eat with ſuch, (the neceſſity of relation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) but as touching an offender in the Church not Juridically proceeded againſt, Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> doubts not, nor any that are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but upon our neceſſary occaſions as our ſeveral callings lead us unto, we may keep company, we may eat, and take more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of familiarity with ſuch then with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, did we live amongſt them as the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> did. Yet doubtleſſe all unneceſſary intimate friendly familiarity is to be declined with ſcandalous brethren, the Church not being in a capacity to judge them, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects her duty through careleſneſſe: but this is more then this text will bear too, but yet is conſonant unto other parts of holy Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Apoſtles ſcope in this chapter, I ſhall aſſert theſe things.</p>
                  <p>That Church cenſures are of ſuch neceſſity,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that without which the well being of a true Church cannot be.</p>
                  <p>If the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were leavened with indulging of one ſcandalous Brother,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what may we judge of our ſelves that tolerate and connive at thouſands for want of the ſeverity of true diſcipline?</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:53614:111"/>
                  <p>If the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was thus chidden by the Apoſtle for their neglect of Diſcipline unto one ſcandalous member,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> What chiding deſerve they that have pluckt up the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, and have laid all waſt, and left our offending Brethren to periſh in their ſinful courſes, for want of the right way and remedy to reform them that their ſouls may be ſaved?</p>
                  <p>That a true Church of Chriſt may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have ſuch ſcandalous members in it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as the Apoſtle enumerates in the 11. verſe.</p>
                  <p>That ſcandalous perſons in the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ought to have the title of Brethren, and to be differenced from the Infidel world, verſ. 11.</p>
                  <p>That leſſe familiarity in civil and ſacred Communion is allowed to the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> then unto ſcandalous ſinners out of the Church, verſ. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>That the Apoſtle urgeth a general rule for the excommunicating of all ſcandalous bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> upon that occaſion of the inceſtuous perſon.</p>
                  <p>That the main and proper end of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> is the reforming of a ſinner, and ſalvation of his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Here is not one word in this Chapter for Suſpenſion from the Sacrament only;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Nay, the Church is not blamed for their giving the Sacrament to that inceſtuous member, but for not puniſhing him for his ſin by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53614:111"/>hence we may doe things that are commanded and lawful with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous brethren not caſt out by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
                  <p>Although this inceſtuous perſon was in Church Communion and fellowſhip with them in all the Ordinances,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> yet the Apoſtle in the 10. chapter tels them verſ. 17. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament; and the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was one of that all, and they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for keeping the Ordinances of the Church, chap. 11.2. and not blamed nor puniſhed for any ſuch cauſe, as their admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an inceſtuous perſon; nor was he puniſhed with others that the Lord was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with, for the profaning his Ordinance in the very time of that obſervance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's not well doing in one that is ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and not caſt out, that doe leaven the whole, but his doing and living in that which is wicked, and being let alone through Church negligence, that leavens the lump.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle no where ſaith,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> if one that is called a Brother be an ignorant perſon or unregenerate, or one that cannot pray <hi>ex tempore, &amp;c.</hi> with ſuch doe not eat, but he inſtances in ſcandalous ſins only.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath a great many words about this, no not eat with ſuch, which had he applyed to a Brother Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53614:112"/>it would be yeelded him; but his argument is a different thing; for it's of a Brother not caſt out by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Can any diſoblige a brother from his neceſſary duties of inſtituted Worſhip, that is not under the binding power of the keyes of Chriſts Kingdome?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Are we as much to decline friendly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity to a ſcandalous brother within, and not ſo much as brought to his tryal, as to one that is caſt out for continuing obſtinate in his ſin?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the caſe doth not hold ſo much as to neceſſary company, and civil eating, (as hath been hinted) much leſſe will it hold in duties of commanded worſhip. Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are of more force to oblige his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubjects, then the private prohibitions of a ſingle Paſtor with his intruded Elders. It's true, they can excommunicate, as well as ſuſpend from the Sacrament; but I humbly deſire ſuch to be ſure that they are intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the exerciſe of Church Diſcipline of binding and looſing, before they put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall examine what he hath drawn from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. to prove ſuſpenſion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Excommunication; his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is unlawful to give the Sacrament to thoſe that cannot eat or drink it, but there may be ſome in the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53614:112"/>Church (not excommunicated) who cannot drink of the Lords Cup.—Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his explaining the tearms, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands cannot eat, in a moral ſenſe, and then the ſenſe is, you cannot lawfully and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably eat and drink the Cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils: the ſum of all is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as God hath forbidden to come to that Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Or, 2. Such as if they ruſh upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, yet can have no Communion with Chriſt, no benefit by it: this he makes to be the ſenſe, and then doubts not but he ſhall make good his argument, <hi>pag.</hi> 27, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave to ſearch into the Apoſtles ſenſe, and then examine how Mr.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> 
                     <hi>Collins</hi> and the holy Apoſtle doe agree in the ſenſe of this Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid ſomething unto this already upon another account; I will be as brief as I can. This is the fourth publick fault the Apoſtle deals with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he chides them for their factious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had about their Miniſters, upon which they ran into diviſions, and making of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, chap. 1.3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he chides them for indulging and tolerating a known member amongſt them in an inceſtuous marriage, which hath been largely handled, chap. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he chides them for their unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53614:113"/>ſuits of Law, Brother with Brother in Infidel Courts before Heathen Judges.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he blames them for eating of things offered in Sacrifice unto Idols, at their Idolatrous Feſtivals in the Idol Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, chap. 8. And to that end he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, and take them off that were guilty; as in the other different faults, he applyed himſelf unto them with different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and means of reforming, (which would be too tedious to ſpeak unto) ſo here in this as it is a different fault he deals with the offenders in a different way to the former.</p>
                  <p>His conceſſion with them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that the thing it ſelf (to them that had knowledge) was not ſimply a ſin: for an Idol was nothing, and unto them there was but one God, and meat commends not unto God, though they had this knowledge, and ſtood upon their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he tels them, If you doe eat, you are not the better, if you doe not eat, you are never the better, verſ. 4.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But then he tels them that this practice was dangerous and of evill conſequence in reſpect of ſome circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Heathen that out of conſcience eat it, as a thing offered unto the Idol, the preſence of Chriſtians emboldened them in their Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of weak Brethren, that have not that clear knowledge in the nature
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53614:113"/>of the thing it ſelf, as ſome had; which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Precedents was ready to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame practice, and not having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf, his conſcience were defiled by the liberty and practice of the other, v. 10. and ſo by conſequence it became a ſin unto the ſtrong, verſ. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then he comes to perſwade with them to forbear that practice upon ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He urges Chriſtian Charity in order unto the edification of others, before knowledge in their liberty, ſo as to uſe it to the prejudice of the weak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tels them his own tenderneſſe in ſuch a caſe, rather then he by meat ſhould make his brother to offend, he would eat no fleſh while the world ſtands.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then commends unto them himſelf and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for an enſample in another caſe, ch. 9. That although they had power as well as other Apoſtles, to marry, &amp; require main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from them, which was no more then Chriſt had ordained and appointed for the Preachers of the Goſpel, yet they uſed not this power, nor required any ſuch maintenance from them: and though he was free from all, yet he became ſervant unto all, to the <hi>Jew</hi> he became a <hi>Jew,</hi> to the weak he became as weak, that he might ſave ſome; and this he did for the Goſpel ſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes it, Know ye not that they which run
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53614:114"/>in a race run all, even ſo run that you may obtain; even as himſelf denyed himſelf in many things (which he might have lookt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) for their ſakes and the Goſpels; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a better prize or reward hereafter, ſo he would have them to deny themſelves in ſome things, that they might doe, rather then to cauſe their Brother to offend ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably, But in the 10. chapter he comes more cloſe, and addes ſeveral arguments taken from their relation they had to God, as they were of his Church and people, and inveſted with ſuch priviledges of gifts and graces, and of Church Ordinances, in which they had Communion with Chriſt, and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he inſtances in Sacramental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well this he yeelds unto them, and then draws his argument,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> they were related unto God as near as we can be, and they had the ſame Sacraments and other peculiar Ordinances of Gods own preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing; yet notwithſtanding the Lord often pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them for their ſins, I and for as ſmall ſins as ſome of them were guilty of; and therefore he would have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (and all others) be warned and admoniſhed by ſuch precedents of Gods ſeverity towards his own; the particular inſtances thereof are written for our admonition. Wherefore let him that think he ſtands, take caution, leſt he fals. It's a dangerous thing to goe to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53614:114"/>the outſide of your liberty, and to put your ſelves upon ſuch dangerous temptations, as to go into the Idol Temple to feaſt with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. Gods people before time have been drawn into Idolatry by ſuch temptations; and ſo might they. And yet ſee the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the good opinion the Apoſtle had of them, he mingles his ſharp with ſome ſweet, telling them, that although ſome of them had miſcarryed, in this very thing, yet there hath no temptation taken you but what is common unto frail imperfect man: but God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hence exhorts to decline the temptation, v. 14. Wherefore my beloved Brethren flee from Idolatry: Two things to be noted,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He doth not call them Idolaters, but his beloved Brethren that were guilty of this fault.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He doth not charge them with flat Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but is earneſt to perſwade them to flee the temptations, appearances, occaſions of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>He ſpake unto wiſe men, that as they gave offence this way, ſo they were able to judge of his arguments and manner of dealing with them; ſtill yeelding unto them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that his arguments might the better take with them to reform them: but ſtill goes on with further conſiderations, that might further convince them, and be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53614:115"/>to reform the evil, by commending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the conſideration of their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion, verſ. 16, 17. compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all, <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the bloud of Chriſt?</hi> Doubtleſſe it was unto the whole Church in a Sacramental ſenſe, as follows, <hi>For we being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> even thoſe that were in fault were a part of that (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) and (all) we are all partakers of that one Sacramental bread, and conſequently of Chriſt Sacramentally; as he gives a proof thereof, verſ. 18. <hi>Behold Iſrael after the fleſh, are not they which eat of the Sacrifices partakers of the Altar?</hi> this they could not deny, but muſt yeeld it, <hi>What ſay I then? that the Idoll is any thing? or that which is offered in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Idols is any thing?</hi> He grants them that ſtill which they ſo much ſtood upon, but yet he ſaith, This is ſomething <hi>that the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice they ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto Devils, and not to God; and I would not that you ſhould have fellowſhip with Devils;</hi> That's the conſequence; and here lyes the argument, If, as you are Chriſtians by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtituted bread, you have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion together, and partake of Chriſt the end of that bread, then as you eat and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in thoſe things that are conſecrated and ſacrificed to the Devill, you have communion with Devils; or as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53614:115"/>
                     <hi>Iſrael</hi> which eat of the Sacrifices of the Altar were partakers of the Altar; even ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with Heathens that eat of the things ſacrificed unto Devils, were partakers of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. This by conſequence was a greater evil then they were aware of; and therefore he tels them, I would not that you ſhould have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Devils; which had they been aware of, doubtleſſe they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it. The Apoſtle having thus brought the ſin home, by ſuch an argument that could not be evaded, then he concludes from hence, that you cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and of the cup of Devils. Ye cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and of the table of Devils. Doe you provoke the Lord to jealouſie, are you ſtronger then he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> verſ. 21, 22. Well, now we are come to the place that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> makes the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his argument, <hi>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils,</hi> &amp;c. That I conceive is to be underſtood thus; ſo long as they profeſt themſelves for Chriſt, and continued in his viſible body the Church, and were partakers of the Sacramental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, they could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin drink the cup of Devils, and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the table of Devils: there was ſuch a direct oppoſition in theſe two Tables, that it was a thing inconſiſtent, or a contradiction for one to partake of both: as a Heathen might not drink the cup of the Lord, ſo a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53614:116"/>Chriſtian might not drink the cup of Devils, there was a diametrical oppoſition in theſe two, even as much as Chriſt and Belial. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly our bleſſed Saviour in another caſe, <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters,</hi> that is, two Maſters directly contrary: <hi>ye cannot ſerve God and Mammom.</hi> And ſo <hi>Elijah, If the Lord be God, follow him; if Baal be God, follow him;</hi> they could not follow both: who will or can imagine that our Saviour ſpoke this to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid ſuch to ſerve God? Or that <hi>Elijah</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to follow God, becauſe he ſaid they could not follow both? And yet Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> ſtrength of phancy hath wryed his reaſon, that he will have the <hi>Corinths</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the Sacrament, and their ſerving of God therein, becauſe they could not doe both. The Apoſtle's end in writing is to reform the evil, by forbidding them the cup of Devils; but Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> end in writing is to forbid them the cup of the Lord, and that's all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that he drives at.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle goes on and grants as much at the laſt as he did at the firſt, <hi>All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient, all things are lawfull, but all things edifie not,</hi> verſ. 23, 24. meaning the things that were ſacrificed unto Idols, upon the ſame account as at firſt, that an Idol is nothing in the world, chap. 8. But the thing was inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and uncharitable, did rather deſtroy then edifie my ſelf or brother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53614:116"/>adviſeth not to ſeek our own, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man anothers wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo he hath done with that, only he hints at another caſe, upon their civil and neceſſary occaſions, if they bought any ſuch meat at the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, they might lawfully eat it without ſcruple of conſcience; nay further, if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer ſhould bid a Chriſtian to a civil feaſt, he leaves them to their own liberty to goe and eat whatſoever was ſet before them. But I have been too long already, yet I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſearch after the true ſenſe of the place, which is not eaſily diſcerned, unleſſe we minde heedfully the ſcope, eſpecially when a thing is in an intricate caſe, and ſo much reaſoning largely held out, proving that to be evill by conſequence, as cloathed with ſome circumſtances, which in it's ſelf, in its own nature is lawful and good, as here; Now I ſhall examine Mr. <hi>Coll.</hi> argument what bottome it ſtands on, his argument is, It's unlawful to give the Sacrament unto thoſe that cannot eat it, But there may be ſome in the Church (not Excommunicate) who cannot drink of the Lords cup — <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> His Major he ſaith, is proved, verſ. 21.</p>
                  <p>I will confeſs that in this place we have the Sacrament ſpoken of, and that thoſe that the Apoſtle blames for drinking the cup of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, were not Excommunicate: but yet I deny that it was unlawful to give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to ſuch;</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:53614:117"/>
                  <p>For 1. it's a great queſtion, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome time for Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> to prove, That eating of things offered unto Idols, was a ſin that came within the verge of the Church to puniſh with putting ſuch out of Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Communion. In the 5. chapter as I take it, thoſe that the Apoſtle deals with in the 10. Chapter, are not in that particular liſt, verſ. 11. which the Church was to judge: doubtleſſe if they had been ſuch Idolaters, that in the 5. chap. 11. he ſpeaks of, he would have threatned the rod, and given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Elders of the Church to put out of their Communion ſuch Idolaters: for their connivence at Idolaters would leaven the lump, as well as an inceſtuous perſon; but herein not a word of any ſuch thing. But he will be ready to ſay, The Apoſtle ſpoke of putting out of Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>union before in the 5. chap. therefore it was not neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it again in the 10. I, but how will theſe things hang together?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To give a charge to the Church to caſt out Idolaters, and then himſelf uſing ſuch mildneſſe of ſpeech, and variety of argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as I have ſhewed, to convince them that it was a ſin, granting the thing in it ſelf lawfull, but evill in reſpect of ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The main argument to prove their eating and drinking in the Idol Temple to be a ſin, was drawn from the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53614:117"/>in which themſelves, as Chriſtians, are ſaid to have Communion with Chriſt, by being partakers of the cup and bread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicrated for to repreſent the body and bloud of Chriſt; in like manner they were ſaid to have Communion with Devils, by being partakers of the cup and meat in the Idol Temple, that was conſecrated and offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idols: and hence the Apoſtle would not have them to have Communion with Devils; as all his other reaſons, ſo this tends ſolely to reform them in that particular of eating in the Idol Temple, and not a word of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any ſuch the Sacrament, as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> would have it, when he ſaith, <hi>The ſum is, they who cannot drink the cup of the Lord, are either</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Such as God hath forbidden coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Or thoſe that can have no Communion with Chriſt, nor benefit by this Ordinance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe that give credit to that ſenſe,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> muſt be ſuch as adhere more to Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> fancy, then the ſenſe of holy Scriptures; what are any of thoſe two, to the text in hand? was any forbid the Sacrament that eat of things offered unto Idols?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doth not the Apoſtle affirm, that they all had Communion with Chriſt in parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the cup of bleſſings? Is not that the very <hi>medium</hi> of his argument? the Apoſtle argues from their Sacramental Communion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53614:118"/>as Chriſtians, to decline Communion with Idolaters. Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> argues from their Communion with Idols, to a none Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as Chriſtians. And thus the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader may eaſily judge of the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his argument, who out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate raſhneſſe moſt groſſely runs upon miſtake, and thence forms a ſilly ſyllogiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. I grant it a ſin to deliver the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe whom we know God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it. But I deny that theſe of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſpoken of are in the leaſt, ſo much as blamed, or in the leaſt tittle forbid the Sacrament, the Apoſtle proves they all took it, and had Communion in Chriſt in it.</p>
                  <p>I wonder that ever a man pretending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſober principles, ſhould be ſo fond as to think, (that thoſe that the Apoſtles writes to as Saints, ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, his dearly beloved Brethren, and writing unto them as wiſe men, and ſuch that had great gifts, and largeneſſe of knowledge in their liberties by Jeſus Chriſt, that knew an Idol was nothing in the world, and that which was offered was never the worſe, every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God was good, and not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Apoſtle yeelds) I ſay, how he comes to think that theſe ſhould be forbidden the Sacrament, and to be ſuch as could not have Communion with Chriſt, makes me wonder: if Saints, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dearly beloved Brethren, whom he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53614:118"/>ſo friendly with, were not under Chriſts command of this neceſſary obſervance in the Church, then here is not any that are, but I have ſaid enough to this already, and all that he ſaith to this text is moſt irrational and impertinent, to prove that ſome in the Church not excommunicated, ought to be denyed the Sacrament; this place proves that they did all partake of that one Sacramental bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. and puts the thing paſt queſtioning. He hath more things in making good his argument, but having pluckt up his ground work, it's too tedious both for me to write, and you to read the confutation of the reſt; for it will fall of it ſelf, you muſt grant him what he ſayes to be true, becauſe he ſayes it, for he is not able in the leaſt to bring any one argument from Scripture to prove ſuſpenſion diſtinct from Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as himſelf ſtates it.</p>
                  <p>I will trouble you but with two things more of his in this argument; for now I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend brevity in all he has further to ſay in defence of Suſpenſion; for I know not any one thing more much material, that I have not fully anſwered in the former diſcourſe, in order to his ſeveral exceptions againſt the <hi>Bar removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſayes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>He hopes we have all too reverend thoughts of the wiſdome of God, to think that he ſhould lay an obligation upon his Miniſters to give this Ordinance unto them, whom he hath

                  <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle proves that all the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that drank of the Lords cup, and eat of that bread, had Communion with Chriſt, and he ſayes, We that are many are one bread, ch. 10.16, 17. And doubtleſſe thoſe that made diviſions, and lived in inceſt, and eat of things offered unto Idols, and that oppreſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by needleſſe and ſcandalous ſuits at law in the Heathen Courts; and thoſe that were guilty of ſuch great ſchiſms and diſorders in the Church, were a part of that many. The very outward actions of eating and drinking

                     </label> but his Minor is falſe, and to be denyed; matter of ſcandal doth not diſoblige any that are within, and of Chriſts family and Kingdome from precepts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute worſhip, as the Sacrament is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be; but rather it is thus, that this precept of inſtitute Worſhip doth oblige all Church-members that are within, to reform their other ſcandalous actions. 'Tis true Chriſt gave to none but his Diſciples. And the Apoſtles directed this obſervance only unto the viſible Churches which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of viſible Saints, by their profeſſion and external calling at leaſt. And who will plead for any but viſible Saints, profeſſing the true Religion externally at leaſt? while they are Church-members and within, we plead the priviledges of that eſtate as all Scripture
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53614:120"/>Churches alwayes practiſed, and yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their members. And ſo long as our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts own our Church for the Church of Chriſt, and our members true members of the Church, they doe but diſcover their own nakedneſſe in all they ſay againſt us, and what's this argument in hand but the ſame with the Anabaptiſts, if not a great deal leſſe rational, then they uſe it for? Had we but that clear precept, or precedent for Inſant baptiſm, that we have for baptized members of the viſible Church, to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in remembrance of Chriſt; I doubt not but there is hundreds of thoſe that would quit the argument, and reform their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. Chriſt ſayes to his Diſciples when it was firſt inſtituted, drink ye all of it. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> underſtands this precept, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for he directs that Church in general to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inſtitution of Chriſt; for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered what he received from the Evangeliſts that did hear and ſee the inſtitution. That queſtion about <hi>Judas</hi> is not very material to the Controverſie, whether he did receive the Sacrament or not: 'tis certain he eat the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and what was the Paſchal Lambe, but a ſign of the body and bloud of Chriſt? and the Bread and the Wine is no more. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he might have taken the Sacrament if he had had a minde to have continued with them during that ſervice, who hindered
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53614:121"/>him or forbad him? if he did not, he had done better to have adhered unto Chriſt in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of his holy Ordinances, (though but a hypocrite,) then by giving way to the Devils temptation to turn his back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Ordinance, and ſeek for oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity how to betray his Lord and Maſter into the hands of his bloudy enemies; but for my own part I incline to believe that <hi>Judas</hi> did receive the Sacrament, but I need not trouble my ſelf with that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid enough as from that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. to ſatisfie any that are impartial. I need adde no more in proof of this, that it is a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon all Church-members to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Sacrament, as any other publique duties of Worſhip. This we ſhall with more caſe and leſſe time make good againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of men, then our adverſaries who oppoſe us, will free themſelves from what the Phariſes were charged withall, namely, in making void the commands of God, by their own Traditions.</p>
                  <p>As for Precedents, the Analogy of the Paſſeover, the practice of the Apoſtolical Churches, which have been urged ſufficiently to ſatisfie any that are ſober of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians judgement, that have not ſuch clearneſſe of reaſon from the Analogy of circumciſion, nor new Teſtament Precedents for Infant
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53614:121"/>baptiſm, as we for free admiſſion of Church-members baptized, and not excommunicated, unto the Supper, and hence were they but as rational in the one as the other, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie would ceaſe amongſt us that are for a National Church.</p>
                  <p>I proceed unto his ſixt Argument,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If there may be ſome in the Church not yet caſt out, with whom the Communion of the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pure; then there may be ſome in the Church not Excommunicate whom the Officers may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin admit to the Lords Supper.</hi>

                     <hi>But there may be ſome ſuch in the Church. —Ergo,</hi>

                  <p>I grant that it is the duty of the Rulers of the Church to uſe all neceſſary and lawful
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53614:122"/>means to preſerve the purity of Church Communion in all acts of publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>I grant that they are in a ſpecial manner to take care to keep the Communion of the Church pure,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as to this Ordinance of the Sacrament; but ſtill I deny that this is to be done by ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, and allow them the priviledges of all other publique Communion in the Worſhip of God as members. That 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8, 13. hath been examined already, and proves no ſuch thing: let it be proved that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Church was leavened for admitting one that was ſcandalous to the Sacrament, or that their Communion is that Ordinance was polluted, by their conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence towards him: or that to deny him the Sacrament was a ſufficient remedy both to reform the offender, and to purge out the old leaven wherewith they were leavened: if the Text will bear none of theſe things, what is it quoted for? The Rod of Diſcipline it's expreſſed clearly from the text, was to reform the ſinner, with the ſalvation of his ſoul, and the Church by doing her duty is correcting, with this merciful end, did clear and purge her ſelf from that ſinful conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence and toleration of ſuch a one. And if this purging was not by excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then I am out, if it was, then Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> is quite out in quoting it, and he hath ſaid
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53614:122"/>nothing in laying the foundation of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as to the keeping of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Communion pure by Suſpenſion. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you mark, for in this very argument many are very much perplexed, as if the only end of diſcipline were to preſerve the Communion of the Church pure only at the Sacrament, and as if the greateſt impurity of Communion in the Church lay in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ignorant unregenerate ſcandalous brethren unto the Sacrament: whereas I dare be bold to affirm, that to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as much the duth of any ſuch, as they are Church-members and within, as any other duty of publike worſhip whatever; and their obedience in that obſervance is as well pleaſing and acceptable unto the Lord (they coming as prepared as they can) as any obſervance in the Church. And if it was not for the correcting of ſuch things that are in their own nature ſinful, ſuch as are nominated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. there would be no need of Church diſcipline. The main end of diſcipline is to reform that which is evill in Church-members, and to encourage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to well doing, that every member may be obedient in all things. And for Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> to ſay, that the Sacrament alone is appointed for ſuch as have ſomething of grace in them, is only his bare ſaying, and doth claſh with the command of Chriſt, as alſo with the peace, edification, charity, and unity of the Church.</p>

                  <p>But he ſayes further, <hi>The Word is called the bread of life, and it is to be offered to dead ſouls. Heathens were ever admitted to hear, and profane perſons are the objects of diſcipline. The Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate may hear, and ought to be admoniſhed as brethren.

                  <p>Or, 2. Therefore Church-members may hear; but the queſtion is, whether he will allow a Chriſtian to hear as a member, or as a Heathen. The profane are the objects of diſcipline: What them? Muſt they not pray, hear, receive, untill they be caſt out by it? Are they objects of nothing elſe? How are they objects of diſcipline that were never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Sacrament?

This argument of his doth better become a Browniſt, then one that pretends to a friendly owning of our Church; but the poor Church may ſay; theſe ſlanders, diviſions, Separations, and confuſions, are the wounds that ſhe hath received by the hands of ſuch friends. All that he ſaith in proof of his Minor hath been ſufficiently anſwered already, both
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53614:124"/>by my learned friend Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> and my ſelf; I intend brevity, for there is nothing left in his following arguments much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. His ſeventh Argument,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Either it's lawful for the Officers to deny the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to ſuch as they finde ignorant, ſcandalous and impenitent, or they are bound to give into ſuch. But they are not bound to give it to ſuch,—Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His proof of the Minor is, <hi>The Officers are not bound to adminiſter the Ordinance to thoſe who they know are not bound to receive it, but the ignorant and ſcandalous are viſibly ſuch as are not bound to receive it.—Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His main proof of this Minor is this, <hi>If ſuch be bound to receive, then they are bound to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt, and to eat and drink their own damnation, which are ſtrange things for a man to be bound in conſcience unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This argument is wholly founded upon that groſſe miſtake of perſonal unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> for <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. ſpeaks not very clearly unto all caſes; that inſtance is of particular treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes between private brethren, which are things of a leſſer nature, yet theſe perſiſted in unto contumacy after the Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition makes one lyable unto Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; but I queſtion whether all publike notorious open ſcandalous ſinners in the Church, be thus to be proceeded againſt, eſpecially when their ſcandalous ſinning is of long continuance, and doth offend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: the whole Congregation in ſuch a caſe is to be ſatisfied, which cannot be by a private repentance (ſhould it be ſuppoſed) upon the admonitionof the Church. I think the inceſtuous <hi>Corinth</hi> was not dealt withall according to that rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. Publike ſins ſhould have publike ſhame, that others may fear, and the offender be brought to a ſerious and notorious repentance, before the Church declare themſelves ſatisfied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into holy Communion; ſo that I think for the Church to proceed gradually in ſome caſes, as ſuch as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> doth inſtance in, is not alwayes neceſſary, nor to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53614:125"/>wait untill the offender appears to be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to be forthwith cenſured. But theſe caſes are not to be left to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of every particular Paſtor to judge of, but to the diſcretion and grave judgement of the ruling part of the whole Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I queſtion whether one that hath been often reproved in the publike Miniſtery, and yet lives in ſcandalous ſins of whoredome, drunkenneſſe, curſing and ſwearing, variance and contention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not to be judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious, and upon that account, the Church being in a capacity, and informed, ſhould upon ſufficient proof without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay Excommunicate him. I leave theſe things to better Judgements, but yet I am inclinable to conceive, that <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. moſt properly reſpects private treſpaſſes which are not openly known, and how that rule ſhould hold to be applyed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to open ſcandals, that cauſe the name of God, and the true profeſſion of Religion to be blaſphemed and reproached, I am not very clear.</p>
                  <p>But now we ſhall examine his Minor, <hi>But ſome may be kept away from the Sacrament that are not contumacious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So may ſome be Excommunicate that are not contumacious, as I have hinted at,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> which if that be true, then the argument fals to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:53614:126"/>
                  <p>But he ſaith ſurely, <hi>Thoſe that are under ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition are to be kept away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he begs; how will he prove it? For where the offence will admit of hearing the Churches admonition, and upon that give hope or ſatisfaction of amendment, why ſhould they be kept from the Sacrament more then the other Ordinances? they not being authoritatively put out of Church Communion, is it rational for to execute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſentence be given?</p>
                  <p>Unto his ſuppoſitions, I ſhall anſwer him, firſt they are no proof.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch may be Juridically ſuſpended,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> then they may be Juridically excommunicated, for it is Juridical Suſpenſion that is now in queſtion. And as it is ſtated the Church may as well doe the one as the other: And the Church need not be long in giving ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in ſuch caſes, if there be clear proof; beſides the Sacrament may rather be rejourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a ſhort time, then that any ſhould juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be offended, or that a ſingle Miniſter ſhould doe that which is not regular.</p>
                  <p>Murder,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> theſt, inceſt, whoredome is Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by the civil Law of the Nation, and if any can diſcover any ſuch, they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach and put them into the cuſtody of the Civil Officers; theſe are gaol ſins, and to be puniſhed by the Judges. And I know no rule that doth warrant the Church to cenſure thoſe that are under the penalty
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53614:126"/>of the courſe of civil Courts of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>If one ſhould grant that in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſome extraordinary courſe at the preſent might be taken; as ſuppoſe ſome profane abuſe at the Sacrament, as to diſturb the adminiſtration by ſome diſorder, I doubt not but the Churchwardens might thruſt them out of the Church, &amp; do the like to any that ſhould come drunk or mad; but what is this to Juridical Suſpenſion diſtinct from Excommunication, as it's uſually practiſed in ſome Churches? Indeed Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> need not have been ſo haſty in aſperſing Mr. <hi>Bote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, pag.</hi> 98. unleſſe he could in ſome ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe prove Juridical Suſpenſion from the Sacrament diſtinct from Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which he hath not yet done, and it's a great queſtion whether he ever will or can.</p>
                  <p>It's true,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that our Church in prudence left the denying of the Sacrament to ſome, to the diſcretion of particular Miniſters, as he alleadges; but then let me tell you, this doth not reach the argument.</p>
                  <p>For 1. this was only in caſe of obſtinacy, being dealt with all by the Miniſter, who was by the Canons and Rubrick of the Church authoriſed thus to doe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such acts of diſcipline were ſubject to the Churches judgement and cenſure afterwards; the perſons conceiving themſelves wronged might complain, and thoſe Miniſters were
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53614:127"/>lyable to be cenſured for going beyond the rule, as ſome have been ſuſpended from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating themſelves, for putting perſons by, upon ſlender proof, even ſuch as their Ordinary upon hearing did not judge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Church urged the act of receiving as a neceſſary duty incumbent upon all of years, and upon that ground both earneſtly exhorted all to come, and puniſhed thoſe that careleſly neglected it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Churches Juriſdiction conſiſted of Excommunication only in caſe of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, but in caſe of penitency, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and publike penance, the offenders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his ſins (humbly in the body of the Church) craving the forgiveneſſe of their ſin in particular, both of God and the Church, did free from Excommunication: The obſtinate was denyed all the Ordinances, except to hear the Sermon at the Church doores, or behinde the Font, the penitent not denyed any one Ordinance: lay theſe things together, and then let wiſe men judge how our Church heretofore doth precedent the Suſpenſion which Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> contends for; namely, that a Miniſter by vertue of his Office, with his Elders may, and ought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture ground to deny ſome the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (not obſtinate) and allow them the priviledge of all other Church Communion as Members. And this he would have Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53614:127"/>although the Church be in no capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to impower them with any acts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline at all, nor have the help of appeals to reſtrain the raſh proceedings of inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate uncharitable zealous Miniſters, whoſe principles tend too much to diviſion, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and confuſion in the Church, who would be more careful to further the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, peace, and unity of the Church, were themſelves under the rod of holy diſcipline Juridically exerciſed by grave, learned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced preſidents, which particular Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in reaſon will not be very zealous for, ſo long as themſelves are left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to exerciſe an abſolute power, to rule as they pleaſe in their own Congregation without controll. I wiſh theſe petty irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular reformings prove not the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora's that hinder the reformation, peace, and edification of the whole, eſpecially where particular Paſtors and Elders are of Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> opinion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That makes a meer nothing of Church-memberſhip without grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That will allow them no other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation then to Heathens.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That will not ſo much as allow them the external titles of Brethren, Saints, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, within, but reproach them with the odious names of Hogs and Dogs, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and of the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they he ſuch as never had the benefit and help of holy
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53614:128"/>diſcipline to amend them, or try whether they ſin out of weakneſſe or wilfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That will take upon him in his own name to diſſolve them from Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and threaten them not to doe it upon pain of damnation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That will make the Sacrament ſtrong meat, that cannot be digeſted by weak doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That knows not wherein the Officers can have any work to keep the Communion of the Church pure, if not in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That will allow no more priviledge in duties of worſhip to the ignorant and ſcandalous, then to Heathens out of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That doth inſolently affirm that a ſingle Paſtor alone, may lawfully ſuſpend from the Sacrament, he being the ruling part of that particular Church.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That upon the matter puts the whole of diſcipline in Suſpenſion from the Lords Supper, either making it the ſame with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or elſe renders Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication needleſſe in the Church.

Becauſe</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> were in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation, and holy in a Covenant ſenſe, and no where blamed or debarred the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances

                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe nothing could excuſe from the not obſerving of that ſervice in its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeaſon, but legal uncleanneſſe, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary journey, upon their lives; if nothing elſe would excuſe, then all others were to keep it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It's clear that ſome did keep the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that were guilty of that which you will ſay was moral uncleanneſſe. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.1. after they had kept the Paſſeover, complaint was brought unto <hi>Ezra,</hi> ſaying, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Prieſts and Levites have not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the <hi>Canaanites, &amp;c.</hi> for they have taken of the daughters for themſelves, and for their ſons, and the Princes have been chief in this treſpaſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I ſay further that in ſome caſes the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were accepted of, in their keeping the Paſſeover, although many of them did eat the Paſſeover otherwiſe then was written, for ſome that were unclean did eat thereof, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It was the will of God that declared
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53614:129"/>that ſuch things upon a man ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and all things he touched ſhould be ſo by his inſtitution only; but there is no ſuch thing declared by the will of God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moral uncleanneſſe in the Church, as to debar them the Paſſeover or any other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He argues from the leſſer to the greater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doth it follow, that becauſe they might not offer any of thoſe two for any vow, that therefore they might not bring their Lambe in its ſeaſon to the Houſe of the Lord, and offer it before him according to Gods command? It was an abomination to doe thoſe things that God forbad; therefore it is abomination to doe that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; that's all the text will prove, as to debarring of the moral unclean from the Paſſeover. Away with ſuch trifling and impertinent applications of holy Scriptures. The truth is, men of his judgement muſt do more then they have yet done; I had almoſt ſaid more then they can doe, or elſe had better never to have ſaid any thing about this argument drawn from the Analogy of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53614:130"/>the Paſſeover: all that man can ſay againſt us from that, doth but diſcover their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in fighting againſt the Truth.</p>
                  <p>His tenth Argument, <hi>It's a ſin in a Miniſter to declare thoſe one viſible Body, who are not one body with viſible Saints; but ſcandalous ſinners are not one body with viſible Saints.

                  <p n="2">2. Are not all that are baptized into one Body, of that Body, and are not the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the Church baptized, and is it a ſin for one to declare that the baptized are one viſible body with viſible Saints? What is a viſible Saint, but a baptized viſible profeſſing Chriſtian, that is a member of the true viſible Church? Is not an offending brother a brother, and within while he is within? If the Sacrament of baptiſm doe initiate into that one body, and the Sacrament of the Supper beſpeaks them ſo too that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: Is it a ſin for a Miniſter to give the Sacrament to ſuch, by declaring that which is true, and which no man can deny that holds our Church a true viſible Church?

If they be Chriſtians, and within, why ſhould they not have their proper titles, and priviledges of that eſtate? If you can make them neither within the Church, nor without, then it's

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  </p>
                  <p>It's true, a Miniſter may be guilty of his peoples ignorance, and may fear and tremble at that guilt, if he neglect all or any due and probable principles of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may in ſome meaſure prepare them to profit by every Ordinance in the Church: But having done his duty, he need not fear to give them the Sacrament, but tremble at the neglect of that adminiſtration, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging weak and ignorant Chriſtians from it.</p>
                  <p>True it is alſo,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that a Miniſter and the Church may make themſelves acceſſory to the ſins of offending brethren in the Church, by their careleſſe indulging of them in their evill wayes, by not reproving, admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cenſuring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which ſinners ſhould be reformed from their evils; otherwayes the Miniſter and Church may partake of thoſe ſins, though they never come to the Sacrament; but this is a conceit of ſome men, that unleſſe a man doe what he can to keep ſuch away from the Sacrament, he is a partaker of their ſins, whereas the Sacrament is his duty as well as any other Worſhip, who is not to be blamed for that, but for his ſins, ſuch works of darkneſſe that the Apoſtle
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53614:132"/>doth inſtance in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. the place that this argument ſtands upon. We are not to reform ſuch offenders in thoſe lawful things, they are but to reform them from the wicked and ungodly courſes that they offend in.</p>
                  <p>I grant that if any in the Church ſhould pollute the holy ſigns of Bread and Wine to profane ends,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in a meer carnal eating and drinking unto exceſſe, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, and were puniſhed for, or if by any rude profane carriage or miſdemeanour, ſhall be diſorderly in the time of adminiſtration, the Officers of the Church not doing what in them lyes to reſtrain and prevent it, might be partakers of their ſins: but this is a caſe which was hardly ever known in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. But as for Church-members that come with reverence, and demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves orderly, and conform to the external actions, according to the rules of inſtitution, there can nothing be proved againſt any for being partakers with other mens ſins, as to this particular, ſo far as I am able to judge.</p>
                  <p>I have now given you an account of Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> 14. arguments, to prove Suſpenſion from the Sacrament, only diſtinct from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. And if I miſtake not very much, I have ſully anſwered them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all his foundations from Scripture and reaſon he pretends to deduct them from.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53614:132"/>What others can doe I doe not know, I will prejudge none of his perſwaſion; but yet I am ſomewhat confident, that the more wiſe men ſearch into this Controverſie, the more they will finde it a work of that difficulty to make good Suſpenſion from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only from Scriptures, and allow the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of all other Ordinances in the Church as members, that they had need follow no other ſtudies but this that undertake it.</p>
                  <p>Touching that authority brought in proof of Suſpenſion, ſo largely inſiſted upon, I cannot examine. And therefore muſt leave it to thoſe that are in a capacity to ſearch and judge; whether Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath dealt any more impartially with his Authors then with the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion, whether any of his quotations,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Ancient, or Modern, doth reach Suſpenſion, as, himſelf hath ſtated it, and as many practiſe it: for it was alwayes to be put in execution by the authority of the whole Church, and not left to the liberty of a Paſtor and his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to deny the Sacrament to whom they pleaſe, without any remedy of appeals.</p>
                  <p>Whether they ſuſpended from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy Supper only,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and allowed the ſuſpended the liberty of all the other Ordinances in the Church as Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Whether their Suſpenſion was gradual and made uſe of only in order to their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53614:133"/>proceedings unto Excommunication, and ſo of no longer continuance then to try the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders obſtinacy, or repentance.</p>
                  <p>Whether they grounded Suſpenſion on the Word of God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or on the policy and prudence of the Church: if he ſay the former, he may doe well to ſhew us their grounds; if the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then that doth much alter the caſe: for Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> doth not urge it upon any ſuch account, nor may the Churches prudence be pleaded, where Chriſt commands, and the Word doth determine.</p>
                  <p>Whether <hi>non</hi>-admittance of Penitents,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens born, Catechumens, unbaptized, were any thing at all unto ſuſpenſion from the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion whether any one inſtance can be given of any Church or perſons that were judged Orthodox,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that ever maintained that a Church-member in poſſeſſion of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was denyed the Sacrament by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Elders, meerly for ignorance and for the omitting of ſome private duties; and allowed the benefit of all other Ordinances in the Church as members, which is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Presbyterian party that Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> defends, or that ever any ſcandalous members were only kept from the Sacrament, without any further Juridical proceedings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Excommunication; or whether any Church ever would ſuffer their members of years to neglect the Ordinance of the holy Supper
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53614:133"/>year after year through careleſneſſe, or meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave them out as Heathens, though born in the Church and baptized. Now I ſay, if that authority which is quoted by Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> will not reach theſe caſes, they are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for his purpoſe, they will not ſpeak to the clearing of the Controverſie in hand. Beſides humane authority only will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the conſcience of the doubtful; it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the authority of the holy Scriptures that muſt ſatisfie conſcience, and be binding unto all. And as it is apparent the ancient Church did erre in their extremity of rigour in their cenſures in reſpect of length of time, ſo it's poſſible enough they might erre in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of cenſures. Not ſo much their practice as the ground thereof from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rule will give ſatisfaction to thoſe that doubt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, let Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> give us au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any Church before theſe laſt ages, that ever made a Paſtoral examination of Church-members of years, of that neceſſity unto the holy Supper, without which they would debar them the Sacrament. By theſe and the like queries, I hope we ſhall hear by ſome of the Presbyterian judgement, or others, by what authority they practiſe ſo many things, not to be found in the holy Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>They agree with other reformed Churches as to ſuſpenſion properly; as the Browniſts and Anabaptiſts doe,

What doth admiſſion upon profeſſion of faith imply, but that all in the Church not ſo admitted, are Heathens and without, making the Lords Supper the initiating Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance into Church Communion, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to cenſures?</p>
                  <p>If of thoſe that are admitted none may be ſuſpended but after admonition for ſome ſcandalous ſin,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and this only is properly ſuſpenſion; Then let me demand of Mr. <hi>Col.</hi> what he will make the cauſe of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

Let him make that good from the Scriptures; which concerns him to doe before he can prove ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament diſtinct from Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in the mean time what he affirms of proper Suſpenſion, is all one with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53614:135"/>and upon the ſame ground, the Church may as well proceed unto Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication as Suſpenſion: ſo that this very conceſſion of his, doth (upon the matter) undermine his chiefeſt ſtrength, and render all he hath ſaid in proof of Suſpenſion as diſtinct from Excommunication, frivolous.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place his pleading, <hi>That they muſt be lookt upon as now reforming a diſordered Church: had former Miniſters done their duties they might have ſaved us this labour of putting our people upon making a profeſſion of faith in order to admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Lords Supper.</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Reformation ſtands in the reducing all Chriſtians to a univerſal obſervance of al the known Laws &amp; Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Jeſus Chriſt uniformly; and not in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of humane inventions, that the <hi>Church</hi> muſt bow unto, in order to holy worſhip: and hence Mr. <hi>Col.</hi> muſt firſt make good, that it is the duty of all in the Church to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profeſſion of faith, or ſubmit to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his Elderſhip, in order to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper, before he tels others what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire now, &amp; ſuſpend for, is to be excuſed, by their being upon reformation now: A ſtrange reformation that's begun in making void the commands of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; carryed on with prejudices and diviſion, and if perſiſted in, may end in confuſion. Was it ever known before now that Reformation began in admitting to the Paſſeover or Lords Supper? it's an abſurd reforming that wil allow thoſe to be Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, and yet deny them to do the duty of a Member and Chriſtian. It was more rational and agreeing with Scripture rule, to correct that general careleſſe neglect in Miniſters and people in order to reforming, then to deviſe a novel way in a ſetled reformed <hi>Church</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt of <hi>Church-memb.</hi> from doing their duty. The care &amp; zeal of our firſt reformers, was both to exhort and to preſſe all of years to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual receiving, not thinking it ſufficient to be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53614:136"/>preſent gazing on, or careleſſe in not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring; and likewiſe corrected thoſe that neglected this holy obſervance: how unlike are theſe mens ſpirits to our firſt reformers? It's true, many Miniſters then were too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of their duties in catechiſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the younger ſort, and ſo it will be ſtill; but what then? Doth that diſoblige Chriſtians from that neceſſary part of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Worſhip? Miniſters neglect their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their people, therefore the people muſt not doe their duty to their Lord; but muſt be left out and levelled with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan world! Had our Church been aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they aboliſhed Epiſcopacy, then in order unto conſtituting and gathering a new Church, a verbal profeſſion of ſaith in order unto lawful baptiſm, had been proper; but to plead it unto reforming but of the ſame Church already imbodyed and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together by baptiſm, is to be wiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is written. If Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> plea be good for the Presbyterian perſwaſion, it holds as good to the Independent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for they admit into Communion upon the ſame principle, <hi>But he would not have this lookt upon as a standing principle.</hi>

But what means all this pleading to excuſe their rigid practices, but that either they queſtion their warrant, or would have us think the caſe is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and ſo will warrant their irregular improper proceedings in order to admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Church-members to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; an argument indeed of late, that doth ſet the whole land at a ſtand to anſwer, but not ſo much for ſtrength of reaſon that is in it, but for a power out of it, that will make any thing hold that's ſaid.</p>

                  <p>Suppoſe all he ſaith were true,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is there no way to reform, but to remove the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Churches eſtabliſhed doctrine, worſhip, and diſcipline, and innovate wayes of our own politick chooſing, different to all other ſetled reformed Churches (as himſelf confeſſes) Say our malady in a great part was ignorance, could not they begun reformation with a more then ordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in teaching and inſtruction, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonition, in the carrying on all Gods ordinances in love, reverence, and unity, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all advantages to promote knowledg, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in time we might have hoped to ſee ſome good proficiency, in the growing up of the whole together by the goodneſſe and bleſſing of the Lord. For it's certain, that the Scriptures teach not any thing about the cenſuring of Church-members for ignorance ſimply, and to deprive Church-members of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Gods Ordinances, for cauſes leſſe then the Scriptures do warrant, is no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but rather an uſurpation upon the priviledge and right of a Church-member. Say again, that looſe and ſcandalous mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers was another part of our malady, is the denying the Sacrament to a multitude of ſuch ſinners, the only way to reform them? What care ſuch for the Sacrament,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53614:137"/>ſo long as it's the ordinary caſe of moſt, and they may have the liberty of all the other Ordinances in the Church as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? How is this like to reform their perſons, when they may be let alone to be looſe and profane, if they doe but keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Sacraments? Such a kinde of reforming that was never read of in holy writ, nor in any Orthodox Authors. Had it not been better to reform according to Scripture rules and precedents, (we judging all in the Church adhering to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion Church-members) to have preſt them unto all Chriſtian obſervance, and to have dealt with them as thoſe that are within? and to have proceeded againſt ſome unto the like admonitions and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mucation Juridically? Gods way is alwayes beſt, and we may groundedly hope to have his way attended with a bleſſing of ſucceſſe in the amendment of the worſt ſinners amongſt us.

                  <p>It's a pitiful ſhift to prevent our ſtricteſt profeſſors from running into the Browniſts Congregations, to practiſe their principles, and ſo become like them in making admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Lords Supper upon a publike profeſſion of faith, the only ground to unite and imbody the viſible Church into Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Communion, and ſo in gratifying ſome few in their error, require ſuch terms unto actual receiving of neceſſity, that the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53614:138"/>baptized in the Church of years are no where bound to ſubmit unto, nor in a capacity to come unto: And yet are under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of actual receiving, unleſſe in plain tearms you will unchurch them, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty them, and ſpeak out as the Browniſts do.</p>
                  <p>But I think enough hath been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as to this, and therefore I ſhall now take my leave of my Reader, having done with the main things in Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> late Book as it oppoſes free admiſſion to the Lords Supper.

                     </gap>bor in my honeſt calling, then by remembring the happy and ever to be deſired Peace and Reformation of renowned Zion. As it is my daily prayer, ſo it is a part of my dayly care and ſtudy to endeavour that the Churches peace and truth may meet in one. And hence it is that I ſo often appear againſt thoſe who upon dangerous miſtakes deſtroy and pluck up the main principles and foundations, on which the Churches peace and reformation ſhould ſtand, and conſiſt in. How ſad are our miſeries like to be in the end, when thoſe that are our profeſſed friends are ever hatching of new unheard of wayes of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53614:141"/>and Schiſm? Amongſt others this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Author doth bear his ſhare, by defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a way that is rarely met withall, and yet cryed up to be the way of truth and reformation according unto Goſpel rule. The way he defends in brief is this, ſome certain Miniſters and Chriſtians have agreed to form up a Church in the choyce of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, Officers and members in ſome one place: The tearms agreed on unto admiſſion to and excluſion from the ſacred Communion of this Church, as to the holy Supper, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a publick profeſſion of faith, or ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a Church examination in giving an account of their knowledge and faith unto ſatisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo likewiſe, as to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, they require not only a freedome from things ſcandalous, but ſome real demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the faith of holineſſe unto admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>This way it appears hath been rigorouſly carryed on againſt the conſent of ſome able Miniſters in thoſe parts. And ſomething is excepted againſt their way by a ſolid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Gentleman I judge; with ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and queries, and objections for them to anſwer and clear in defence of their way and practiſe. Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> in behalf of the reſt hath taken ſome pains to give ſatisfaction unto others, profeſſing himſelf ready to ſtand or fall, as the truth is with him or againſt him in their practiſe: It's an ingenuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53614:141"/>I confeſſe; and if he will but ſtand to it, I doubt not of the iſſue, but that it will be worth our labour to diſpute it with him according to Scripture and Reaſon, the only Judge of Truth. Beſides, I am the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclined to enter the liſts with him in this Controverſie, becauſe he proteſts againſt a rigid ſeparation from a true Church, and declares himſelf only for a moderate and lawful ſeparation in the Church; not as yet diſowning our Churches I take it.</p>
                  <p>Unto this I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>That Separation that is proper and lawful in the Church,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> is either made by Orthodox Doctrine;</p>
                  <p>Or 2. by wholeſome Diſcipline Juridical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed;</p>
                  <p>Or 3. we may and ought to withdraw all unneceſſary friendly and intimate familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſcandalous brethren, where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duties of our general and particular callings will permit without prejudice to our ſelves. And then the queſtion will be, whether the practice defended in reſpect of ſeparation be no more but ſo: if it be but Doctrinal, or putting out of Communion Juridically by Excommunication, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining all unneceſſary familiarity with the ſcandalous though tolerated: all will be yeelded on his ſide. But if it be found other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I ſhall deny it as dangerous, and warn all Chriſtians to avoid it, leſt they be infected
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53614:142"/>with Schiſm, a curſed fruit of the fleſh; and drawn into ſuch needleſſe ſeparations as can never be warranted. It's one thing to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the ſinful courſes of ſcandalous brethren, and another thing to ſeparate from the neceſſary duties of Gods Worſhip, and of our calling, where ſuch are tolerated. It's one thing to exclude the ſcandalous Juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, another thing to exclude the ignorant who deſire to be learners of wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; or thoſe that are not ſatisfied to yeeld unto their tearms, as preſented under the neceſſity of duty, when upon ſearch their terms are but the bold inventions and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſtrong fancies, and not to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any ſuch account as is pretended. Yet I ſhall adviſe to a condeſcenſion to the ſame terms upon a prudential account, for the help and incouragement of all in ſaith and knowledge: provided it be uſed to no ſuch end as to exclude Church-members from that neceſſary duty of inſtitute wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought not to betray their own and their brethrens liberties to thoſe that have the boldneſſe in theſe exorbitant times to invade them, and bring all into diviſion and confuſion. Why ſhould not all that are within, and of the Church, enjoy all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal helps and means of their amendment, untill the Church hath taken the forfeiture of their offending, and iſſued out judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53614:142"/>againſt them? I think I have writ more to this then will be anſwered in haſt. Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> would be judged a ſober moderate man that ſtill owns our Church, Miniſtry and members for true. But yet we finde him ſo inconſiſtent to himſelf, that upon the matter he unchurches all our Parochial Congregations, that he will not allow them to be Churches, but in an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating ſenſe; that is to ſay, in no ſenſe as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>riſh in it's Precincts; but as a ſeparate Church may be in a Pariſh, as in the world. We doe not ſay, ſaith he, that our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are Churches as Pariſhes, but that they are Churches in Pariſhes; and in that ſenſe Pariſh Churches, <hi>pag.</hi> 127. and yet he is ſharp againſt rigid ſeparation, and pretends but to Surgery, not to Butchery: but if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching of our Parochial Aſſemblies be not a rigid Butchery, let him tell us what is more rigid. They of the Independent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doe generally acknowledge our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to be the Churches of Chriſt, though out of order. The Anabaptiſts will confeſſe, a Church may be in a Pariſh, as well as in a City, Country, and World, and in this ſenſe they may ſay there are Churches in Pariſhes, and ſo Pariſh Churches. How is our Church beholden to ſuch pretenders that will ſpeak as much in defence of our Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as they ſtate them, as our adverſaries will grant? And yet he hath the happineſſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53614:143"/>to be approved of by a learned Gentleman for his recommending to the Church a well tempered Reformation, if love to his perſon and cauſe deceive him not: Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> in his approbational Epiſtle to this Book.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, if thoſe we plead for be not members of true Churches in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then all muſt needs goe againſt us; for it is certain that Heathens, the unbaptized, or ſuch as have renounced the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may not eat thereof; our opinion pleads for all Church-members of years bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and not excommunicated, as knowing not any rule againſt the admitting of ſuch to the Lords Supper, produced yet by any. And yet Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> ſaith peremptorily, amongſt all others, none have deſerved worſe of the Church of God, then thoſe that plead for a looſe way (as he cals it) of receiving all ſorts of perſons to holy things: and by promiſcuous adminiſtrations proſtitute the Ordinance of God to every comer. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this paſſage from ſo reverend a Miniſter as he is reputed to be, did enter my very heart at firſt, and plunged my ſoul into a greater perplex of paſſion then is ordinary. Yet not out of any apprehenſion of guilt, (though I have alwayes cauſe to flee unto Gods mercy for acceptance) but that ſo good a man, and an eminent Miniſter of the Goſpel ſhould be ſo inconſiderately raſh in his cenſure of the Churches friends.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53614:143"/>
                  <p>But to anſwer directly;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doth not Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> receive all ſorts of Chriſtians unto Gods Ordinances of Word, Prayer, ſinging of Pſalms, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of holy baptiſm? Are not theſe holy things? And is it looſeneſſe in himſelf to admit all ſorts of perſons in the Church to partake of theſe? I hope not, and why then not in the other, it being a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty to all in the Church, of years, (as the Ordinances before named:) he might doe well to give ſome better reaſon then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe. When he can charge us juſtly with pleading the admiſſion of the unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, Heathens, the Excommunicate; then let him charge us with that odium of looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or a looſe way, as being againſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-rule; but untill then his charge and cenſure is no other then a raſh ſlander un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming ſuch a perſon. It's ſtrange and to be admired, that our preſſing unto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian obſervance to thoſe that are baptized, profeſſing Chriſtians, and of the viſible Church, ſhould have ſuch a hard ſenſe put upon it, as to be branded with looſeneſſe; when in all other duties preſſing to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence according to rule is accounted godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and holy ſtrictneſſe. But doubtleſſe that way that is the neareſt to Goſpel rule, is the good way and ſtraight way. However it may have the hap (upon miſtake) to be called a looſe way.</p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:53614:144"/>
                  <p>Truly to ſpeak freely, I little value that perverſe diſputing in moſt that oppoſe us, that are forced to uncovenant, unchurch, undiſciple, unduty a Chriſtian profeſſing baptized people to make out their argument and own invented way, againſt ſuch mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt demonſtration, which cannot otherwiſe be anſwered: and yet for the zeal of the Churches peace and priviledges we defend in behalf of her members, we are counted the greateſt enemies to the Church; none deſerve worſe of the Church then we, no not Ranters, Quakers, Antitrinitarians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Browniſts, that deſtroy all the Church is in poſſeſſion of, through the gift of his grace; for there are ſome amongſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that deſerve bad enough ſure, but we deſerve worſe then all theſe, if this good man ſay true. As for looking at a worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt (he hints at) I have as little cauſe as ever had any man, I have what I lookt for before I ingaged, to have many tongues and pens againſt me, even of them I eſteem my very good friends; which thing I have put my ſelf upon with no ſmall reluctancy of ſpirit; what the Lord intends by it for good or hurt, I am not certain, but content to ſubmit to his pleaſure and further guidance in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, being well aſſured of this, that I ſhall not looſe my labour of zeal and love for the Churches peace, and edification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I ſhall ſpeak one word more to vindicate

If we doe not deſerve worſe of the Church then the Author himſelf approves of, I hope the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader will forgive us the wrong, and what himſelf hath publiſhed will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit us. And I doubt not but when our principles and theirs are laid together, and compared impartially, as I have given ſome diſcoveries in theſe followings ſheets; it will not be very difficult to judge, whether they or we deſerve worſe of the Church of God. And ſo I will leave Mr. <hi>Mantons</hi> hard cenſure to himſelf and others, that ſhall read both to judge between us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould hardly have troubled you with theſe ſheets had not that paſſage much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked me, nor would I hinder that reverend Gentleman ingaged; he may rejoyn more deliberately, if he ſee cauſe. I think I have done enough to caution the Reader of leſſe judgement from being taken with this Author, with whoſe ſmoothneſſe of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and plauſible pretences his Reader may quickly be intangled, and carryed away with a ſound of enticing words that have no truth nor ſolid reaſon in them. I ſhall now upon the ſudden come to examine the main of his Book.</p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:53614:145"/>
                  <p>And my way will be firſt to examine what himſelf relates of their way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall examine the ſtate of the queſtion, and the proofs urged to defend it, anſwer his arguments, queries, and motives, and then conclude.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> tels us what their way is: <hi>There is a Church formed in one of our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the rule of the Word. In the choyce of a Paſtor, Officers, and Members; other Miniſters and people are joyned to this ſociety, in which we are like to walk till we can ſee truth or reaſon againſt us,</hi> pag. 121.</p>
                  <p>To this ſomething may be yeelded,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> as namely, that where a people is deſtitute of a faithful Paſtor, they may chooſe one that is qualified for the carrying on the whole work of the Miniſtery in the Church. And the people to ſubmit unto him as ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in the Lord; I mean ſo far as his Office and Function doth authorize him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to rule, to admoniſh, warn, rebuke, and command.</p>
                  <p>Then ſomething is to be denyed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> untill further proof of their practice appear.</p>
                  <p>As namely, 1. That he that is a Paſtor of a particular Congregation, and Church, or flock, (unto which he was either lawfully ſent, and inducted by the Church, or came in by the conſent of the people over whom he is) I ſay for ſuch a one to joyn himſelf to another Church as a common member,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53614:145"/>and to hold conſtant Communion in the Sacrament with that Church, and altogether neglect the adminiſtring of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that people he is Paſtor of; I utterly reject as that which the Scripture doth no where allow, but is contrary to reaſon, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, peace, and edification of his people; if it doth not imply a forſaking his Paſtoral relation and duties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I would gladly ſee it made out by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that one that is a Paſtor of a Church already, may be choſen a Paſtor again, either by the people he is Paſtor unto, or by others that have lawful Paſtors over them already; if this practice be permitted in thoſe that are confeſſed by the Author to be true Churches, (which they dare not ſeparate from) What a deluge of diſorder &amp; confuſion muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow! Can a man be a Paſtor of a ſelect company out of ſeveral Churches, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to his own people in general he was firſt related unto, denying the Lords Supper to them that are properly his own flock, &amp; give it as Paſtor to other mens flocks and charge? Or can a man be Paſtor of a true Church, and an Officer of another? Or a particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate member in conſtant Communion with another in acts of worſhip? Theſe things have need of ſugred words indeed to make them paſſe; yet this is repreſented unto all with the common guiſe of every Sect, to be according to the rule of the Word; when
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53614:146"/>Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> hath given us his proof to make good theſe paradoxes hinted at, and further declared and explained their way, we may have occaſion more ſtrictly to examine it in all the particulars of it. In the mean time I can conceive no leſſe of their way, but that it makes ſuch a rent in their ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that moſt properly and juſtly is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Schiſm; pleading neceſſity will not help you, eſpecially when it's of your own make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, running upon ſundry miſtakes, and taking principles upon truſt for truth, that the holy Scriptures no where teach, brings moſt knowing men under theſe ſtraights, overwhelming the Church with diſtraction, diviſion, and confuſion. Beſides, there is no neceſſity to ſin upon pretence of reforming, that Reformation that is begun by ſinfull means is not of God, nor can never tend to the Churches good. Arguments drawn from pretended neceſſities are of little ſtrength in a ſober rational diſpute, however prevalent they are conceived to be, when accompanyed with the ſword. How can thoſe Miniſters think they have done their duty in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the holy Supper to their reſpective Congregations, by drawing a few of their own members with them to receive it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans Congregation? They may as well think they have done their duty in preaching to their own Congregation by a conſtant drawing a few of their people with
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53614:146"/>them to hear another man preach; and if the other be their Paſtor, as to ſome in the way they are in, cannot be denyed, why ſhould not ſuch members conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him in all publick adminiſtrations, as their duty? And with what conſcience can ſuch live upon the Churches maintenance, that forſake their function and duty to their Congregations? And if they make the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the diſtinguiſhing Ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church and the world, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor cals it ſome where, then no wonder they are ſo tender who they admit into the Church; and thus upon the matter they look upon the greateſt part of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations as Heathens, unbelievers, whom the duties of Chriſtianity doe not concern. In another place he ſaith, <hi>an unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is far from being a diſciple, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not a Chriſtian, for the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch.</hi> And hence they deviſe ways and bars to keep them from the Lords Table equall unto a Heathen. But me thinks they might eaſily perceive their miſtake; for baptiſm of old was accounted the only diſtinguiſhing Ordinance; as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion between the Church and the world, and the only ſeparating and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance in the Church is Juridical Excommunication, which they make no uſe of, for Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> ſaith they Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate none, if they judge their people
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53614:147"/>Church-members and within, if they have any ſcandalous crime againſt them, why do they not begin reformation by caſting out the obſtinate, according to rule? they are all for admiſſion of members, when they ſhould be for ejecting in the work of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If they be for admiſſion into Church Communion, they muſt begin with baptiſm, and I think the tearms they ſtand upon in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Supper, will ſooner be made good in order to baptiſm, of grown ones, then to thoſe that are initiated into the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by lawful baptiſm, I have writ enough to this already; the truth is, if my judgment fail not, Mr. <hi>Saund.</hi> doth but ſhuffle, when he ſpeaks of our Aſſemblies to be true Churches ſome of them, one while they are true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and have both matter and form (which are the main eſſentials of true Churches) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by al, only he ſaith, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great diſorder at preſent, (Diſcipline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrupted, as I ſuppoſe he means). And he muſt needs ſpeak this in behalf of our Parochial Churches, for he makes mention of the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> of which ſome he will undertake to prove to be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, againſt thoſe that deny all for matter and form to be true, <hi>pag.</hi> 127. And yet in the very ſame page he contradicts himſelf, in ſaying, <hi>We doe not ſay our Aſſemblies are Churches as Pariſhes, but that they are Churches in Pariſhes, and in that ſenſe Pariſh Churches:</hi> and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53614:147"/>in the page before, <hi>he thinks the truth of ſome of our Churches, (as to their Eſſence) he can prove. A Church may be in a Pariſh as well as in a Country, or City, (as</hi> Epheſus, Corinth) <hi>yea as well as in the World.</hi> By this you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what a good friend he is like to be to our Pariſh Churches, againſt Anabaptiſts, and Browniſts: that although he accounts them rigid Separatiſts, they will grant that there are ſome Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> that ſome that are godly and real members of Chriſt dwell in them, which they will confeſſe are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a true Church. Nay, there may be a rigid ſeparate Church in fellowſhip and order in a Pariſh as well as in a Countrey, City, World. And in this ſenſe they are Pariſh Churches. What ſhifts are theſe? but why doth he not ſpeak plain to the caſe in queſtion, and clearly ſpeak his judgement of our Parochial Congregations as they are baptized, and adhere to the publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in general, conſiſting of good and bad, nay the moſt very ignorant, and in ſome thing or other either ſcandalous, offenſive, or remiſſe? Will he prove ſuch Pariſhes in their Precincts and outward bounds, to have both the matter and form of true Churches? If he would doe ſo, I ſhall imbrace him as friend of the Church. And one would think in his 128. page that is his ſenſe, by what he infers for baptiſm: ſaying, <hi>That all Infants born in our Churches are to be baptized,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53614:148"/>for Congregational Churches (as they are called) baptized all their Infants,</hi> and then, <hi>If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that ſundry of the parents are ungodly whoſe children we baptize, he asks whether they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny baptiſm to the childe of any member how offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſoever, before the ſentence of cutting off paſſe upon him?</hi> So he anſwers of ours. <hi>Theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed wicked ones, whether (as carnall or profane) are not excommunicated, what therefore ſhould hinder their childrens baptiſm?</hi> Hence he owns all in our Churches that are baptized mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Chriſtians, and within; for I ſuppoſe he would not plead the baptizing of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe that are Infidels and without, that are no objects of Excommunication. And yet in other places they are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſciples, Church-members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, he ſaith, <hi>as to baptiſm we ſuppoſe our Churches to be true, but ſick, and corrupt,</hi> pag. 126, but wherein corrupt? if all be true you publiſh (129. <hi>pag.),</hi> wherein you adde to what you ſaid before? Beſides the children are not baptized in their Parents right alone, but in the Churches, <hi>where the childe is born a member, being holy federally by birth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> You prove the Subjects of our baptiſm lawful, the Miniſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm it ſelf for matter and manner I preſume; wherein is it ſick and corrupt then? I could wiſh you were more ſteddy in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; conſonant to your ſelf, and honeſt to your Reader. But to reply upon your own
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53614:148"/>grants: if all children born in the Church he holy foederally by birth; then it follows that all parents in the Church of whom they are ſo born are believers, for the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that only of the children of believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. And then if all parents in the Church be believers, why doe you not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Lords Supper to them? for actual receiving is the undoubted duty of all believers; how you will deny the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I cannot tell. I pray you conſider well of my Anſwer unto Mr. <hi>Collings,</hi> for I muſt be very brief to yours.</p>
                  <p>Again if our Churches be true Churches; and all it conſiſts of lawfully admitted into it,</p>
                  <p>Then it will follow, 1. That while they are within, they are to enjoy all external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of our Church according unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel rule, which is one and the ſame unto all Church-members as ſuch. This is ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and clear, that all that ſeparate from us, own and practiſe it; untill a member by Apoſtaſie fall off, or be Juridically caſt out of Church priviledges.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Paſtors of true Churches are to attend their ſeveral flocks in a conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the whole miniſterial work they are deſigned unto, by the Church that ordained them ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That forming a Church in the choyce of a Paſtor and Officers, members, in a true Church already formed according unto rule,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53614:149"/>(as to the eſſentials thereof, at leaſt) is a work not only ſuperfluous and abſurd, but Schiſmatical and pernicious, breaking the peace and union of that Church they are of by making unneceſſary rents and diviſions in it. It is not ſeparation from a Church, but ſeparation in a true Church cauſeleſly, that is properly a Schiſm: abſolute ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a true Church is properly apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in an Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe, I take it. Hence his diſtinction of ſeparation from a true Church, and ſeparation in a true Church where the ordinary means of ſalvation is, and the fruits thereof, (as himſelf confeſſes of ours) is groundleſſe and wicked. The firſt ſort come under the cenſure of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> 1 Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>Judes</hi> general Epiſtle, verſ. 19. The laſt ſort are detected by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. Chap. 11.18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23, 24, 25. chap. 14.33.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall a little touch upon what this new formed Church requires of perſons they admit into Sacramental Communion with them. And I will give you the queſtion as themſelves have ſtated it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether in the reforming of a long corrupted Church,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Saund.</hi>
                        </note> it be neceſſary that all the members thereof doe ſubmit to ſome examination or tryal of their knowledge before they be admitted unto the Lords Supper.</hi> This queſtion they fear not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the affirmative; <hi>Here they ſuppoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53614:149"/>in our Churches, and therefore with men well ſatisfied with their preſent frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not looking on them as under any ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, as we ſuppoſe: with ſuch we deſire not much to diſpute, we can expect little of reaſon, or truth from men of that minde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This queſtion is but ambiguouſly ſtated,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> and ſhould be further explained as to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branches of it: for as to our Church in reſpect of doctrine, it muſt be ſpoken with thankfulneſſe, that long hath the light thereof filled our <hi>Horizon,</hi> as himſelf confeſſes <hi>pag.</hi> 6. and this Examination is only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſound knowledg, the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Church was not corrupted in, ſo as to deſerve the denomination of a long cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Church in that reſpect. For gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the principles that were taught, and received by the people were Orthodox, that the people cannot in reaſon generally lye under the Suſpenſion of heretical knowledge, for they have been ſo long habituated to ſound words in reſpect of ſeveral Creeds which very frequently were profeſſed and aſſented unto in our aſſemblies, with ſuch plainneſſe of Catechiſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that in reſpect of the ordinary means of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples knowing in a competent ſenſe (which is the ſubject matter that examination and trial only relates unto in the queſtion) that the Church cannot be truly ſaid, to have been a long corrupted Church. And then that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53614:150"/>clauſe in the queſtion <hi>(as to us)</hi> is needleſſe, which indeed upon the matter is the very cauſe of the queſtion, that being taken away makes the queſtion fall, for then the queſtion will be, Whether in a reformed Church, as to knowledge, examination be neceſſary in all we admit to the Sacrament? And I judge this the moſt proper queſtion, by what himſelf hath acknowledged of our Church in reſpect of <hi>purity of Doctrine,</hi> the only means of ſound knowledge to her members, they being generally educated and trained up therein from their youth; ſo that as to knowledge the Church was not corrupt; That many of her members have but little knowledge, and are weak in the faith, is confeſſed, and is their ſin, but whether it be ſuch a ſin that the Church may chaſtiſe with diſcipline, I very much doubt of: they being otherwiſe not tainted with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous offending. And how a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould be denyed a neceſſary duty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute worſhip without ſome proper act of diſcipline, I cannot tell. I confeſſe had the generality of our people been poyſoned with Popiſh heretical principles, touching the holy Supper, and all other worſhip, there had been a rational cauſe of the queſtion, as he hath ſtated it, and a ground ſufficient to be ſuſpicious of the knowledge of moſt, whether that little moſt know were true or falſe, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox or heretical. And if upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53614:150"/>or tryal they ſhould be found heretical, and will not be reclaimed, I think ſuch come under the chaſtiſement of the Church; but this is not our caſe, nor queſtion.</p>
                  <p>If by the word (neceſſary) in the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be meant a duty incumbent upon all to ſubmit unto, and that every one muſt ſtand to the trial of their Paſtor and Officers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their knowledge, before they can lawfully be admitted unto the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; It will be denyed, and the Author muſt give us ſtronger proofs and arguments for the affirmative then what he hath urged in his <hi>Antidiatribe;</hi> we ſhall examine his proofs anon.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould grant him that it might be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in reſpect of ſome benefit and help to a more profitable receiving, if people would come off in ſuch a prudential way, only to that end they may be prepared better, but to make uſe of it to that end, as either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them from their duty, or exclude them from a neceſſary duty of ſolemn worſhip, out of a perſwaſion that their knowledge is incompetent, this I utterly diſlike as raſh and groundleſſe.</p>
                  <p>I grant that the Church actually impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with the exerciſe of true diſcipline,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may and ought to convent any of her members, before them complained of or ſuſpected for matter of ſcandal, and examine them, and finding them guilty and impenitent, may
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53614:151"/>cenſure them, but the queſtion intends ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>
                  <p>I grant that ſelf Examination is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty in order to receiving, and that may ſatisfie the queſtion as it's ſtated; for that is (ſome examination) to receiving as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is, when this is indevoured of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtians, although they neglect that which is Paſtoral, it's a queſtion whether they deſerve to be excluded or no. But to reply. If Church Examination be a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty to all admiſſion: As he would; why not unto every time they come to receive? For that examination that the Apoſtle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, holds to every time the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is adminiſtred; but they require it but once, and that only upon a ſuppoſition of a general corruption of our Churches, (<hi>p.</hi> 22.) But were not the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally corrupt as ours at ſome times, and yet at ſuch a time did not as godly men as your ſelves call all to obſerve the Paſſeover without ſuch a way of examination you plead for; think of <hi>Joſiah, Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. You confeſſe the Paſſeover and Supper are the ſame for ſubſtance; and in anſwer to the firſt objection, you ſay Chriſt had communicated with his Diſciples before in the Paſſeover, therefore he needed not examine thoſe that were admitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: If your reaſon be good, I ask what need you examine thoſe that have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53614:151"/>to the Louds Supper before? Nay what need you examine thoſe that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto holy Baptiſm before, that are of years, not excommunicated? That which was neceſſary unto Baptiſm was ſufficient to admiſſion into the Church, where Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion (only) is: and which none ever was denyed in the Apoſtolical Churches during their abode in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And to thoſe that judge ours lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized, and in a true Church, cannot rationally refuſe to admit them while they are within. And again if the examination defended be a neceſſary duty, why not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all Church-members of the ſame kinde? Neceſſary duties uſe to be univerſal. How comes this to be reſtrained only to ſuch as well may be ſuſpected for incompetent knoweldge? Sure if it be a neceſſary duty, it is incumbent upon all in the Church, or elſe to none at all; if a Miniſter be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſpenſe with ſome, a gift may blind their eyes at length. But what Scriptures determine of the juſt meaſure of this compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge that the Ignorant are to be examined of, without which they muſt be excluded the Sacrament? if no certain rule can be found to ſatisfie us in this, how can men determine of it? Then it will follow, as in all other doubtful or groundleſs things; ſo many men, ſo many mindes, and will but adde more fewel to our too many hot
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53614:152"/>diviſions already. And know an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable duty of publick worſhip ſhould be made void upon ſuch trifling uncertainties, that not any are able to determine of, ſeems to me, too great a boldneſſe in man. Thus as briefly as I could, I have not only que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned the queſtion, but have examined it in particulars thereof, by explaining and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, and by denying other things intended by the Author. And I think the true queſtion is this.</p>
                  <p>Whether it be the duty of all profeſſing the true Religion, (and admitted into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and Communion of the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by holy baptiſm, and conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the publick Worſhip of God) to give an account of their knowledge and faith upon the command and examination of their Miniſter and Officers, and either to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or refuſed the Lords Supper, as theſe examiners ſhall approve, or not approve, of the meaſure, truth and ſoundneſſe of the knowledge of all, and whether all that refuſe to ſubmit to this duty, are juſtly to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>I dare ſay that's the proper queſtion as to our caſe, and now I come to examine the Scriptures and reaſons laid down by Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> to prove the affirmative. Namely, that all are bound to ſtand to this tryal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can lawfully be admitted to the Lords Supper: His quotations are many,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53614:152"/>and he is ſomething large upon them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt deſire the Readers patience in my anſwer; yet I will promiſe thee I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid all tedious impertinences.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> firſt proof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order. This,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is a general rule, ſerving till the worlds end, to direct the Churches in matters of outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whereof this of admiſſion to, and excluſion from the Lords Supper is one.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> reproves the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinth</hi> for her diviſions and diſorders in their publick Aſſemblies, in the very time of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Lords Supper, and preſcribes them rules and orders in ſpecial as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of thoſe profane diſorders: ſo in this chapter he takes them up for ſome other diſorders they were guilty of, in the like aſſemblies in the carrying on of ſome other exerciſes of Religion amongſt themſelves, as verſe 26. doth intimate: <hi>How is it then bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren when you come together, every one of you hath a Pſalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation? let all things be done to edifying.</hi> The fault was this, in the exerciſes of theſe different gifts by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons, they obſerved no order, but made a confuſion, all exerciſing their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular gifts at once, that not any could be edified by anothers gift; either for his own, or becauſe ſo many ſpoke together, that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53614:153"/>thoſe that were hearers could not tell which to attend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore after many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular directions preſcribed to particular caſes, leſt the Apoſtle ſhould omit ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, that might fall out about the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Worſhip in the Church of God, he gives them more general rules that might reach all other the like caſes. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi> The Apoſtle orders ſpeech and ſilence in their Aſſemblies ſo, as all may be edified and comforted, but here is not a word of admiſſion to and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Sacrament, nor any other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in the Church: for they that were received into the Church, were bound as Chriſtians to attend upon all Ordinances of publick Worſhip, while they were within: this rule was given to direct us about ſome neceſſary circumſtances in the ordering of neceſſary worſhip, which other Scriptures inforce upon all in the Church to obſerve, as time and place, and external order in all parts of inſtitute worſhip; decent and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent geſture, ſilence and watchings, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed adminiſtrators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> conſequence is falſe, for it is not ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule as he would have it, namely to warrant a Miniſter to receive of his people to duties of neceſſary worſhip whom hee pleaſes, and refuſe whom he pleaſes, is this to direct in matters or circumſtances of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip, to exclude Chriſtians from
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53614:153"/>their neceſſary duties of worſhip? If this will warrant his excluding from one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of worſhip, then from all at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; if a perſons admiſſion, and excluſion be but a circumſtance of outward worſhip, then our Biſhops did well in forbidding preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing in the afternoon, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thoſe that made conſcience of their duty otherwiſe. By this Church-members are not left at liberty to doe what Chriſt commands, but what the Church commands: we may ſee how ways of mens own chooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will warp them. If this conſequence had been publiſhed by a Biſhop in their times, Chriſtians would have ſtartled at it. But he goes on. <hi>And ſuppoſes, they had no particular warrant in Gods Word to bear them out, yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if our courſe be holy and orderly, it hath warrant from that general rule.</hi>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53614:155"/>but are not all things ſanctified by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Word to the whole Church? And are not all things clean to them in a federal ſenſe? Is there not grace and mercy enough in the Goſpel Covenant made to the profeſſing Church, to cure the worſt, Gods bleſſing concurring with the neceſſary means uſed to that end? Let not men be dividing where God joyns by his own conſtitution and merciful gift, comprehending the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral children of all parents in the Church with the Church, for the gathering of his elect out of them all. To call this a mixture in an evil ſenſe as corrupting the Church and Ordinances, is a ſlander and an unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach brought upon the Church by raſh and inconſiderate heads, care is to be taken for the exerciſe of true diſcipline, for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſcandalous, as is provided in all my writings.

                  <p>The people of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were in a moſt deſperate apoſtaſie in the reign of King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the time of this holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets propheſying, for they had forſaken the Lord and his preſcribed worſhip, which but a little before godly <hi>Joſiah</hi> had put them in poſſeſſion of according to the laws of God, left in writing by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but his ſon being wicked, turned to Idolatry, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with him ran a whoring after ſtrange Gods, inſomuch that the Lord complains of them, according to thy Cities are thy Gods oh <hi>Judah,</hi> for which and many other of their abominable doings, the Lord ſent his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Jeremie</hi> to denounce Gods judgements againſt them, eſpecially that judgement of their being ſubdued by the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and carryed away captives by him.

If thoſe you ſeparate from in that of the Sacrament be under the obligation of Chriſts command, as they are profeſſing bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Chriſtians, which none can deny up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good ground, then Chriſts command is of ſufficient warrant to juſtifie their lawful joyning with you, as in all other commanded duties of worſhip you ſeeme to practiſe; the antecedent hath been proved already from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be yeelded I hope.

                  <p>Thirdly, The remedy preſcribed to reform the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt there is no difficulty at all, that the Apoſtle meant a brother, one that was within, and a Chriſtian, all agree: ſo as touching the nature of the ſin writ about it is clear enough. (How Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> ſhould be ſo wide is to be admired, in applying the remedy to wrong perſons, verſ. 2.) It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the fault or ſin intended was this, there was one, or ſome of that Chriſtian Church that altogether neglected the workes of their particular calling, and lived in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not working at all, verſ. 11. and not only ſo, but that ſuch were guilty of that common vice that alwayes attends idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they were (buſie bodies) in the ſame verſe, and this is uſual when a mans minde is not taken up in ſome lawful calling, he is ſubject to thoſe temptations; for want of buſineſſe of his own, he will buſie himſelf with other mens, and for want of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his own, which idleneſſe brings upon him, he is ready to thruſt in where he can, and backbite, flatter, invent tales, tending to the diſquiet and contention of the places where
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53614:160"/>ſuch are, this ſeems to be intimated, ver. 12. In the firſt part of the remedy he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the authority of Chriſt, that with quietneſſe they work, eating their own bread, yet they might the rather be gently dealt with, becauſe they having newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of Chriſtian hope of eternal life by him, they might be ſo taken with this mercy, that it might take ſome off from their neceſſary occaſions, and make them think that they ſhould alwayes be talking and ſpeaking of the things of Chriſt, they not conſidering the inconveniences that would follow thereupon, not only the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening of the Church, but giving an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the growth, and putting forth ſuch vitious corruptions (hinted at before) that the corrupt nature of all men are more or leſſe inclined unto.</p>
                  <p>The remedy preſcribed conſiſts of ſeveral parts, I ſhall but touch at things.</p>
                  <p>A command in a double reſpect.

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt was when he was with them in perſon, verſ. 10. and this ran upon a penalty, <hi>This we commanded you; that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat:</hi> notwithſtanding this charge the Church was careleſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in putting this into execution, and did relieve them, and too much countenance them in that diſorderly courſe, inſomuch that ſome complaint was made againſt the thing. <hi>For we hear,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that there
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53614:160"/>are ſome that walk diſorderly, not working at all, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 11. and in order to this ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence of the Church, he layes a ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in the authority of Chriſt upon the Church to withdraw from ſuch, verſ. 6. in reſpect of civil familiarity and maintenance according to their charge, as before.</p>
                  <p>He repeats the command again in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that in the authority of Chriſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and in poſitive tearms; <hi>That with quietneſſe they work, and eat their own bread,</hi> verſ. 12. and further tels them, if any one ſhall refuſe to be obedient according to this Epiſtle, the Church ſhould note them, by ſome ſign of diſtinction, declining that wonted and friendly famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity as to others that lived orderly; and ſo doing, would be a means to bring them into ſome ſhame, and amendment, and clear the Church of the guilt of ſuch diſorders; I mean the Church in general. Beſides I ſhould have taken notice how the Apoſtle preſſeth upon them his own practice when he was amongſt them, verſ. 7, 8, 9. for the Apoſtles they wrought with labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not power and liberty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear working, but to make themſelves an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample unto all in the Church to follow them: and that they might not be chargeable to any.</p>
                  <p>But laſt of all, leſt the Church ſhould run on the other hand into too much ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in ſtead of healing and amending of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53614:161"/>the offender, deſtroy and looſe him, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling him out of their ſociety, as they would an enemy, the Apoſtle puts in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate caution, <hi>yet count him not as an enemy,</hi> (or Infidel, as we judge of one that is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate) <hi>but admoniſh him as a brother,</hi> (or one within) under a more gentle cure.) So that I conceive the moſt ſeverity here intended, was to decline all friendly fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, by withdrawing their friendly countenance and kindeneſſe, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reprove and admoniſh them, for their amendment; this ſeems to be but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar drawn from a more general rule, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſſe, but rather reprove them, nor partake in other mens ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> ſaith, <hi>This ſenſe that I pitch upon in reſpect of the penalty is too little, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is too much: quoting</hi> Eraſmus, pag. 140. he ſaith further, <hi>it muſt be ſuch a noting and withdrawing, as tends to the ſaving and reforming of ſcandalous and miſliving brethren; ſuſpenſion from eivil ſociety is leſſe ſhaming.</hi>

                     </label> They may doe well to give ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why the declining all friendly fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in reſpect of civil courteſies, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is too little to bring ſuch brethren to ſhame, conſidering thoſe times, and of what neceſſity it was of to have the love and furtherance of the Church; all Chriſtians being ſo lyable perſecutors, unleſſe they were
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53614:161"/>ſuch that would revolt from their Chriſtian profeſſion upon the leaſt danger.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The puniſhment in a civil ſenſe was ſo ſharp, that had all in that Church but done their duty, in putting it into execution, the offender muſt either have reformed, or have been pined to death, or forſake the Church; for every member was under an Apoſtolical command, If any would not work, neither ſhould he eat, had the whole together, or a part made conſcience of their duty, they might have humbled the proudeſt, and brought them under ſome yoke or other I warrant you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If this was too little for ſcandalous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living brethren, as he ſaith, then why is not ſuſpenſion from the Lords Supper too little, eſpecially where moſt in a Church are upon the matter ſuſpended, as with them of their way? many of which are neither ignorant nor ſcandalous, nor any way of a miſliving courſe, and can it be imagined that any that are ſcandalous miſliving bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhould ever be brought to ſhame by keeping them from the Sacrament (only), when ſo many of them that are brethren of honeſt and good repute are kept away as well as the other. It's both a vain and abſurd thing to pretend to the right means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and yet ſo to uſe them as to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly diſappointed of the end. Nay where ſuch reforming as theirs is once in acting,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53614:162"/>what's the event and end, or fruit that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but ſtrife and debate, contention, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, prejudices, back-biting, quarreling and queſtioning what ſuch a Miniſter preaches, with deriſion and confuſion, and ſuch like deſperate fruits, as experience doth daily ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If excommunication be too much for ſcandalous miſliving brethren, that would not reform, as is ſuppoſed of theſe in the text, why then it will follow as before, that none ought to be excommunicate at all, for none can be worſe in the Church then ſcandalous miſliving brethren, ſure, that will not reform.</p>
                  <p>But to come to this argument in the cloſe of this Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> forms it up thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Noting offending brethren ſo as to ſhame them, is holy and neceſſary. But ſuch is our ſuſpenſion of miſliving men. Therefore holy and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How wide his Major is from the text needs no great diſcovery to the Judicious,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> but for the ſake of the weak, and leſſe intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader ſomething ſhould be done. Had the Apoſtle writ to the Church to take any courſe they could deviſe to bring theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly brethren unto ſhame, then his Major had been tolerable, but when the Church is directed to the particular way and means to bring ſuch to ſhame, as in the text; and the Church to invent ſome other wayes drawing
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53614:162"/>a general from a particular is evill: if any kinde of noting will but ſhame them, (then it's holy and neceſſary) from this text, it would as well follow, that the ſtocks or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory is ſo to note offending brethren as to ſhame them, therefore holy and neceſſary from this text; what may not then be aſſumed to be holy and neceſſary, if it will but ſhame men? But I have ſhewn above that their way brings none to ſhame, and therefore hath not the leaſt colour of warrant from the text. The Lord give them hearts to conſider of it.</p>
                  <p>His fourth proof to prove examination a neceſſary duty unto admiſſion to the Lords Supper, is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>If any man that is called a Brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, drunkard,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with ſuch one no not to eat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If we take not to eat in a civil ſenſe, then they raiſe their argument from the leſſer to the greater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If we take it for Sacramental eating, then we have an Apoſtolical injunction againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ungodly ones to the Lords Table: and by conſequence an allowance of ſeparation, as to ſuch, and of tryal in order to it,</hi> pag. 141, 142.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſhall ſee what himſelf ſaith in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all this, in that which follows in the ſome page.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The whole chapter concerns Church-fellowſhip &amp; cenſures. It is about caſting out of the inceſtuous perſon, as every one ſees: Doe not we judge them that are within, put
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53614:163"/>away from among you that (or the like) wicked perſon. Again, he ſaith that the nature of the recited ſins, verſ. 11. ſhew that he intends ſcandals calling for diſcipline and coming under the like cenſure with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt; thus far himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 143. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from his own ſenſe of the context I conclude that this text allows of no other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in the Church, but what is made by Juridical Excommunication; for doubtleſſe the inceſtuous perſon was only ſo ſeparated from the fellowſhip of the Church: and this is the ſame which I alwayes plead for and would have reformation begin withall. Let him draw what conſequence he can from his own ſenſe of the text for their ſeparation, when he confeſſes in another place that they excommunicate none.</p>
                  <p>By this the intelligent and ſober may know what to judge of the way he defends, that is ſo point blanck to his own quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for in the text reforming the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the Church is onely by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; and they excommunicate none, but ſeparate from their Churches, leaving the infectious and diſeaſed to cure themſelves, or periſh for them, by neglecting thoſe due and neceſſary Ordinances appointed for their amendment: but in my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> I have ſpoke largely to this Scripture, whither I ſhall refer you.</p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:53614:163"/>
                  <p>His fifth proof is <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive he doth draw any thing from it at all in proof of the queſtion in hand, and I having largely ſpoke to it in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Collings,</hi> it's needleſſe to repeat: beſides, I have anſwered to more difficulties from Mr. <hi>Collings,</hi> then is urged by Mr. <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So alſo his ſixth proof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. to the end, is fully anſwered, no more need be added untill what I have writ in my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> be throughly anſwered and confuted. All that I can finde of Mr. <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> amounts but to this; If ſelf-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be neceſſary to goe before receiving, then ſuch as doe not, or cannot, ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And hence they will inforce it the duty of all to be examined, that they may know who are able to examine themſelves; and thoſe that upon this ſearch they finde not capable, exclude them.</p>

And truly I cannot but admire at the wiſdome and providence of God only wiſe, that hath by ſtrange workings made void from time to time what hath been prepared in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the exerciſe of diſcipline; I doubt not but when our principles are more the minde of Scriptures in regard of the bleſſed and priviledged ſtate of the whole viſible Church in Covenant relation with God, the Lord will favour us in his great kindeneſſe, by putting the poore deſpiſed Church of the Nation into a poſſeſſion of that diſcipline that is moſt the minde of Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53614:164"/>in the Word. In the mean time we have all need to pray much, for we are under an hour of temptation, and many are ſcared by it.</p>
                  <p>I come to his ſeventh proof, <hi>pag.</hi> 148. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Neither be partakers of other mens ſins.</hi> The ſum of what he ſaith to this, was not enough for a Miniſter to give the unworthy warning of the danger, or to reprove and denounce Gods judgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impenitent to free him from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſins.</p>
                  <p>This may clear him as a Preacher, but not as a Ruler or Steward, for if the ſame Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall looſe the ſame men by giving them the ſeals of the New Covenant, which is to tell them that they are intereſſed in Goſpel priviledges and promiſes, he fears that the guilt that was thruſt out of the fore doore, comes in again at the back doore.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The main of the queſtion lies in this,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> whether the Miniſter admits any ſuch who are by the Authority of Scriptures forbid to come, he not doing what he regularly may to exclude them. I ſhall eaſily grant that a Miniſter through careleſneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe may be involved in the guilt of their peoples ſins, as touching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the queſtion is, when a Miniſter hath laboured to inſtruct his people, and hath given warning of the danger of eating and drinking unworthily, and hath ſtirred
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53614:165"/>them up to come reverently and orderly, carrying themſelves ſutable to the external actions there required, hath not done his duty in an Evangelical ſenſe, as to that of his, that every Miniſter is a Ruler, and therefore to urge upon them acts of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and Juriſdiction as a Ruler, when the whole Church is without diſcipline, is ſuch a boldneſſe, that never any pretending to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber principles aſſumed, (untill theſe exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant times we are fallen into) for want of holy diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>But he grants that in reſpect of all, the Miniſter doing his duty as before, is clear as a Preacher. And that is ſufficient from his own mouth to juſtifie thoſe that dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume no other power in the Church at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but what they have by vertue of their Miniſterial Office. And as Stewards they are bound to be faithful in the diſpenſing of that, leaving the iſſue to the bleſſing of their Maſter. And it concerns Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> to prove himſelf a Ruler, and impowered with the actual exerciſe of the Keyes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in his Church, before he take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to binde and looſe at his pleaſure; if he be ſo impowered, why doth he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his own Congregation, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all the Ordinances in his own Church? Why doth he not by his authority convent the ſcandalous before him, and admoniſh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, Excommunicate, without any fear or

If there be none in his Congregation over whom he rules, lyable to his cenſures to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, why doth he neglect to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the holy Sacrament unto them? If there be ſcandalous members in his Church, why doth he connive at their wickedneſs, and ſuffer himſelf to be leavened by his careleſſe indulgence towards them, partaking of their ſins, foraſmuch as he neglects the only means to reform them by Juridical Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. If he ſay, he keeps them from the Sacrament, I anſwer, But the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were commanded to do more; Was it ever read of in the Scripture, that a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor refuſed to adminiſter the holy Suppe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What though you plead but for Suſpenſion, ought not that to be Juridical as you are a Ruler im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered ſo to act? And have you ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with all your people that are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the holy Supper? I pray you Sir, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me in theſe things, either by ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounds, or by your Reformation as you are a Chriſtian and a Miniſter of the holy Goſpel.

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> would have it thus, That Miniſters muſt give an account of the ſtate and condition of their people, I think; or if he mean, they muſt take knowledge of their ſpiritual eſtates, that they may know how to apply themſelves toward them both in private and publick with ſeaſonable words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in reference to their own account: I ſee no great hurt in that; nor doth it prove any ſuch thing the text is quoted for.

But I never was acquainted with any ſuch promiſe as himſelf tels his Reader of, made to Goſpel times, that there ſhould be no ſtrangers in his ſenſe and meaning, that is, no ſcandalous ſinners in the viſible Church; no tares among wheat, no mixture of good and bad.

                  <p>Beſides 1. How doth it call into queſtion all Churches of the Goſpel, that ever were? for there were ſcandalous and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in them all.</p>

But what reaſon can any of ſober principles give, that God will not now in the Goſpel times own ſuch a graceleſſe profeſſing people for his people, as he hath done before the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh?</p>

A <hi>Jew</hi> by nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion had all the Church priviledges of a <hi>Jew.</hi> In like manner, a Chriſtian by nature and profeſſion hath all the Church priviledges of a Chriſtian, only with greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; foraſmuch as the priviledges of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church are more clear and ſpiritual, tending more unto the ſpiritual profit and edification of the whole. And what reaſon, beſides the good pleaſure of God, can any man give why the Lord ſhould vary in theſe different adminiſtrations? Moſt certain it is, that ſince Chriſt was manifeſted in the fleſh, and juſtified in the Spirit, and aſcended into glory, greater hath been the advantage both of knowing and believing in the Son of God, in compariſon of attaining unto knowledg and faith in Chriſt, by thoſe that had but ſome darke obſcure diſcoveries of him by types and ſhadows; for men now to ſay that God looks for more at our hands then of them, is rational. But to affirm that the Lord in Goſpel times will not own a Chriſt-profeſſing people that have not real grace, is altogethere groundleſſe, and a little too peremptorily ſpoken, without better proof then <hi>Camero.</hi> And it's too harſh to affirm
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53614:174"/>that a meer want of reall grace doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant a Chriſtian profeſſing people, and that God will diſown them for his people upon that account, they being holy fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by birth, and upon that account bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and thereby put in poſſeſſion of the Sacramental Seal, which himſelf will grant. And would the ſame men but argue as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally from the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, as touching grown ones, as they doe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, this Controverſie about who ſhall be admitted to the Sacrament would have been frivolous.</p>
                  <p>But now Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> hath done with the texts which he ſaith <hi>Conclude poſitively for their practice in gathering and diſtinguiſhing their Communicants, by examining. What all theſe lights will doe being ſet up together, who knows?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewiſe,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> I have now done with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining of what you have concluded from theſe ſeveral texts for your way, and I hope I have given both your ſelf and every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unprejudiced reader clear and rational demonſtrations, that there is not ſo much as one of theſe 15. texts that will prove exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a neceſſary duty unto the Lords Supper, as it's ſtated. Nor hath Mr. <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> ſo much as applyed them (for the moſt part) to prove the queſtion. So little is his own confidence of the pertinentneſſe of his own quotations; for ſome of them he hath applyed to prove ſuſpenſion, and others to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53614:174"/>prove excommunication, which in order to their way of gathering they meddle not with at all, nor is it proper ſo to doe in the way they have deſigned, their way being rather to admit unto memberſhip, then the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Church-members from the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church they have formed. But Sir, how doubtfully doe you expreſſe your ſelf at laſt, as if your ſelf were in ſome doubt whether theſe texts make for your way or not, <hi>What they may doe, who knowes?</hi> and yet in the beginning of the ſame ſentence you ſay, <hi>they conclude poſitively for your practiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may well aſſure you (Sir) that it's a grief to my Spirit, that ſuch ſober godly moderate Gentlemen as your ſelf ſeems to be, ſhould ingage in a practice before you could tell how to make it out by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of holy Scriptures againſt all the world. Had you been ſo happy as firſt to have ſeen an undoubted warrant, before you had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this ſeparation, you ſhould never have been one in that ſociety, whileſt you had lived. How an ingenuous and rational head can withſtand ſuch plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that by the aſſiſtance of the Lord I have expreſſed my ſelf in, in oppoſing yours, and indeavouring to give the true ſenſe of the Scriptures in debate, I cannot tell; I muſt and doe commend all that is written to the powerful working of the Spirit of Truth and Grace, to perſwade
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53614:175"/>and incline the hearts of the godly, to ſee where truth and the Churches peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation lies, according to plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent rule. I doubt not but your own heart will bear me witneſſe, that I have rationally diſcovered the moſt (if not all) your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and concluſions as applyed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend your practice, to be meer miſtakes and impertinent. I beſeech you conſider ſeriouſly, how ever you will be able to give the Church of God ſat is faction, for running into ſuch a needleſſe ſeparation that is altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture warrant. Nay, doe but think how you will anſwer your Lord, for breaking the peade and union of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, rayſing prejudices, bringing your perſons and Miniſtry into contempt, by making ſuch a groundleſſe rent and ſchiſm in his Church: and that to the great prejudice of his viſible ſubjects; ſetting up laws of your own chuſing, urging them upon your people as neceſſary, or elſe muſt be excluded, (as to you) the neceſſary Laws of Jeſus Chriſt their abſolute Lord. You ſay well, (as every conſcionable ſober ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtian ſhould) that you are ready to ſtand or fall, as the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall determine. In charity I am bound to believe that you intend no leſſe then what you have ſoberly publiſhed. Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath ſo over-ruled the action, (that one that is a meer ſtranger unto you; I not ſo
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53614:175"/>much as hearing of your quality, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then I can gather by your Book) to give you a ſudden anſwer, wherein you are now upon the tryal of your ingenuity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, there to make good your practice you are acting vigorouſly in, or to return to your own flock, and withhold nothing that is from them. If you ſeriouſly ſearch into the conditions of your people, I believe you may ſee cauſe to confeſſe that you have loſt more in your reſpective flocks, then you are like to recover while you live; at leaſt ſome of you. Pleaſe not your ſelves with what is ſo much pretended in this giddy age; Namely, to act in reforming in ſome pure and ſtricter way. For many have run them out of all, under ſuch like pretences. Be holy and ſtrict as it is written according to the known and undoubted rule of Scripture Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; and be aſſured that that's the pureſt way, for you know, not our own way, be it never ſo ſpecious; but the way of the Lord is the ſtraight way that leads to life in glory, and if you return, and be ſaithful in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the things of God, as you are obliged by the Word, that's the way that God will own, the way of the Churches peace and edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the way to make Miniſters a bleſſing to their people, and their people a bleſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and the only way both to unite and to reform the whole. The Lord give you a heart to be ſerious and ſearching after the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53614:176"/>ſafeſt way, in the further diſcharge of thoſe relative duties, as Paſtor of a Congregation, whom you are ſet to watch over, and warn and feed alſo in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe unto you, that I have been ſomething more round and rude in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then is ſo well becoming; conſidering the moderate temper of our Author. But the Lord is my record, that I have not any ſlight eſteem of his perſon; but am verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he is a precious, able ſober, Divine, that expreſſes much of true godlineſſe in him. It is partly the want of ſome eaſier &amp; ſmoother expreſſion; partly my zeal of the Churches peace, ſo miſerably plunged into diviſions and ſeparations, the great impediments to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; partly becauſe I would provoke to more ſearching into this Controverſie about admiſſion to &amp; excluſion from the Sacrament, for I ſee that our over rigid principles in this, doe run us upon other dangerous rocks. Partly to vindicate my ſelf, and thoſe of the ſame perſwaſion from what we are cenſured for, by Mr. <hi>Manton.</hi> But if any thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſeable, that your charitable conſtruction cannot moderate, I beg your pardon, for I affect not to be bitter, nor would I be guilty of any incivility towards any godly Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall go on, and come to examine his convincing arguments, laid down as ſeconds to the Scriptures alleadged, <hi>pag.</hi> 156. and the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53614:176"/>firſt is this, <hi>Becauſe the holy Supper belongs to godly ones, real believers men have a right in Gods ſight on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſuch: They that have no true grace, have a ſeal ſet to a blanck. Men ſtand in the viſible Church as they are apprehended to belong to the inviſible; all this,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is ſoundly proved by our Saviour adminſtring to Diſciples only,</hi> Matth. 26.26. <hi>not to Diſciples in the largeſt acceptation, for many profeſſed beſides: but to ſuch as were more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar was it given. And his practiſe is to be a rule to the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> ſtrength in proof of this argument ſtands in two things.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> 
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In his aſſerting ſeveral things that are uſually taken for granted, without any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al proof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In urging the practiſe of our Saviour in the firſt adminiſtration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. as proving ſoundly all the particulars aſſerted in the argument, he denying that this was an accidental circumſtance, but was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by Chriſt ſo to have it, but his enumeration of particulars are meerly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and argued againſt in my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Collings,</hi> unleſſe it be this, that men ſtand in the viſible Church as they belong to the inviſible. I know not any ground why we ſhould apprehend that all in the viſible Church doe belong to the inviſible of Gods Elect: for in the Church amongſt them that are called, it's ſaid that <hi>many are called, but ſew are choſen;</hi> though it's true in a negative
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53614:177"/>ſenſe in this reſpect of particular perſons we cannot exclude any one from Election.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> argument in form, as to the ſubſtance and ſenſe, is thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such only that Chriſt gave the Sacrament unto, have right to receive it; But he gave it to none but holy ones, Diſciples by peculiar choyce</hi>—Ergo, <hi>holy ones, diſciples by peculiar choyce (only) have right unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The argument is ſo weak and feeble that to the Judicious it needs no anſwer;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> but for the help of the weak ſomething would be ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Were there no other Scripture preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Precepts, Intimations, for clearing and warranting the right of thoſe that are to be admitted, but the firſt preſident argued from; then it would have poſed us to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it; or to prove the continuance of it to the Churches uſe at all; becauſe at firſt it was given to extraordinary perſons in Office only. But if he will allow the whole of holy Scripture he might ſee enough to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the right of all in the Church in general without any peculiar choyſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. ch. 20.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If this Preſident, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. were fore-determined by Chriſt to be an example and rule for the Church; then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who muſt adminiſter this Ordinance now according to this pattern? Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only bleſſed, and gave it unto Apoſtles only.</p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:53614:177"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Then it will follow, that none but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Office, and of the Miniſtry ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then the greateſt part of ſincere Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and followers of Chriſt ſhould be left out; for without doubt there were many ſuch at that preſent that were not admitted. Beſides the ſeventy Diſciples ſometimes ſent forth to preach the Goſpel, there were other holy perſons both men and women; the names that preſently met together for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and divine imployments were about an hundred and twenty; of whom ſome choyſe perſons are named, as <hi>Mary</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Jeſus, and other women, and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> and <hi>Barſabas, Act.</hi> 1.14, 15, 23. which Chriſt gave not the Sacrament unto: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this preſident muſt be our rule, no wonder they refuſe as good as they admit, nay better then they admit; for without doubt Chriſt gave it to ſome, that afterward diſcovered great ignorance and unbelief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides one of them was a Devil.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this preſident muſt be our rule as it's urged, then there muſt be a choyſe of ſome peculiar holy ones, out of holy ones admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as holy and ſincere refuſed. And yet ſee how the Author prevaricates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from this preſident in another place: where he ſaith, <hi>Our way is only to exclude the viſibly unworthy, and no others,</hi> pag. 166.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53614:178"/>
                  <p n="3">3. If all that Chriſt gave the Sacrament unto were not holy, then the argument will fall of it ſelf; but Chriſt gave it unto <hi>Judas</hi> whom he knew was a Traytor, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with other of his enemies to deſtroy him: therefore all that Chriſt gave it unto were not holy ones, and ſo the argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>als. That which is to be made good is the Minor; for indeed ſome are in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Judas</hi> received the Sacrament or no. And therefore I ſhall a little touch upon that: and it will be made good from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. his own quotation: in this text, Chriſt gave the ſignes of his body and bloud to his Diſciples, and ſaid, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body; Judas</hi> was one of his Diſciples that ſate down at the Table, verſ. 20. <hi>When Even was come, he ſate down with the twelve,</hi> and one of this twelve ſhould betray him, verſ. 21. and that <hi>Judas</hi> continued at the Supper it evident, verſ. 23. <hi>He that dippeth with me in the diſh, the ſame is he.</hi> And St. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. chap. of his Goſpel, verſ. 17.20. relates juſt the ſame with St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Then come to Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 22.14, 21. he agrees with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that all the twelve ſate down, and he in ſpecial ſpeaks of the actions done at the Table the twelve ſate down unto.</p>
                  <p>Namely, 1. The eating of the Paſſeover, verſ. 15, 17, 18. Then Chriſts celebrating this ſacred Ordinance, bleſſing and breaking bread; to be done in remembrance of Chriſt,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53614:178"/>verſ. 19.20. And now having related the main actions that were performed thus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly at the Table, then he relates what words fell out to be ſpoken at the Table, verſ. 21, 22. notwithſtanding Chriſts love in this familiar manner expreſt to them, and theirs to him both in the Paſſeover, and holy Supper; yet Chriſt tels them that one of them ſhould betray him: and <hi>Luke</hi> you ſee relates theſe words as being at the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe holy appointments of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and holy Supper. And thus we may conceive a clear agreement of theſe three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, that <hi>Judas</hi> was at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and did doe as the other did for any thing in the leaſt hinted at by theſe three, that wrote firſt of this holy hiſtory. And how ever it ſhould come into the head of any ſo much as to ſcruple ſuch a thing, whether <hi>Judas</hi> (one of the twelve that ſate and eat at the ſame Table with Chriſt and the other,) received the holy Supper or no, eſpecially there being not the leaſt hint of his excluſion or withdrawing more then of the other: is to be admired. Without doubt we may ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conclude from theſe three, that <hi>Judas</hi> received the Sacrament of the Lord, as well as <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> for they are not recorded to have received it by name in particular, but as they were his Diſciples, and of the twelve, that ſate down at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But then you will ſay, how comes it
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53614:179"/>to paſſe, that this of <hi>Judas</hi> receiving or not, is made ſuch a great controverſie in the Church in all ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which hath occaſioned this Controverſie from the four Evangeliſts is in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.30. <hi>Judas having received the Sop, went immediately out, and it was night,</hi> hence it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <hi>John</hi> hath relation to the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Supper, and this ſop was ſome part of that ſervice, and upon his eating this, the Devil entred, verſ. 27. and he went out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the Lords Supper was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and given; and brought about his actual treaſon in a part of that night. This place and ſenſe hath occaſioned the queſtion, and quarrel, as to <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo far as ever I could meet with any colour of reaſon. Therefore now I ſhall both briefly and plainly give you my thoughts how to reconcile the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and to ſatisfie any that are rational, I hope.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It can never be proved, that St. <hi>John</hi> doth ſo much as mention, or mean the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Supper in the 13. of <hi>John,</hi> at all, only he gives a more particular account of that Supper, which Chriſt and his Diſciples had together at <hi>Bethany,</hi> two dayes before the feaſt of the Paſſeover, in the houſe of one <hi>Simon</hi> a Leaper, where a woman poured upon Chriſts head a box of very coſtly oyntment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the Evangeliſts ſpake of this Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.2, 6, 7. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.1, 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.1, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53614:179"/>1, 2. all the doubt is of this of <hi>John,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the ſame with the other three.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſult the words and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, v. 1. <hi>Now before the Feaſt of the Paſſeover,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> hath it, <hi>You know that after two dayes is the Feaſt of the Paſſeover. Luke</hi> upon the ſame ſaith, <hi>Now the Feaſt of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread drew nigh, which is called the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> thus far you ſee there is no diſagreement; only <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> are more punctual for the ſpace of time before (namely) two dayes, then <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They all agree in this, that <hi>Judas</hi> began his treaſon, made his bargain before the Paſſeover night or Supper, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1, 2. compared, <hi>Now before the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, and Supper being ended, the Devill having now put into the heart of</hi> Judas <hi>to betray him.</hi> Even now before the Paſſeover came at a private civill Supper in <hi>Simon</hi> the Leapers houſe, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil firſt put it into <hi>Judas</hi> heart to betray him. And then <hi>Luke</hi> relates the ſame, chap. 22.3. &amp; 1. put together. <hi>Now the Feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over drew nigh. Then entred Satan into</hi> Judas, <hi>one of the twelve, and he went his way and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with the chief Prieſts, how he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him unto them. And they were glad and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonted to give him money, and he promiſed and ſought opportunity to betray him in the abſence of the people,</hi> verſ. 4, 5, 6. Then after this came the Paſſeover, verſ. 7. Thus it is clear the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill entered into <hi>Judas</hi> before the Paſſeover
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53614:180"/>Supper. Now if the ſop <hi>John</hi> ſpake of, had been at the Paſſeover Supper, (which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded Satans entring and prevailing, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Judas</hi> upon treaſon,) then how will <hi>Luke</hi> be reconciled, and the other, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> which ſpake the very ſame with <hi>Luke, And from that time he ſought to betray him, Matth.</hi> 26.16. that is, after he had made his bargain for thirty pieces of ſilver, verſ. 15. all this was done before they went into the City, or could tell where to keep the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, verſ. 17, 18. The very ſame is in <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.10, 11. Thus far we ſee an agreement of all the Evangeliſts, that the Devill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Judas,</hi> and he had plotted and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the treaſon before the Paſſeover Supper, and therefore this of <hi>John</hi> cannot be meant of the Paſſeover night.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſop preceding Satans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring was before that night, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3. is expreſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe that Supper, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1, 2. was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the ſop in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.27. was that which did immediately precede Satans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, prevailing with <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Maſter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe when after the ſop our Saviour ſaith, <hi>What thou doſt doe quickly,</hi> the other Diſciples not knowing what it meant, thought becauſe it was ſpoken to <hi>Judas,</hi> he having the bag, that Jeſus had bid him buy
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53614:180"/>thoſe things that they had need of againſt the Feaſt, verſ. 28, 29. and therefore it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſeover Feaſt began, there being no lawful buying and ſelling, when the Feaſt of the Paſſeover was begun. If any ſhall ſay, that St. <hi>Mark,</hi> chap. 14.20. ſpeaks the ſame with <hi>John;</hi> and it's clear, that of St. <hi>Marks</hi> was ſpoken in relation to the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Supper, and therefore the dipping a ſop in <hi>John</hi> was at the Paſſeover; for they ſeem both to relate to the ſame thing.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath relation to the Paſſeover Supper, but then I deny that both theſe dippings were the ſame, and at the ſame time. <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith, Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, one of you that eateth with me ſhall betray me,</hi> v. 18. Nay Chriſt came nearer, and ſaid it was one of the twelve, that dipped with him in the diſh; and ſo left it in the general amongſt them, which cauſed every one to ſuſpect himſelf: But this in <hi>John</hi> ſeems to be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing; for this of dipping and giving was occaſioned by <hi>Johns</hi> private queſtion, verſ. 25. Lord who is it, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> leaning on Jeſus breaſt, (being put on by <hi>Peter</hi> to move the queſtion). Jeſus gave this ſign privately only in anſwer to <hi>John; He it is to whom I ſhall give a ſop, when I have dipped it, and he gave it to</hi> Judas, <hi>and ſaid, What thou doſt doe quickly.</hi> This diſcovered the Traytor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>John</hi> only; <hi>For no man at the Table knew for what intent Chriſt ſpake thus unto him:</hi> this
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53614:181"/>is a far different thing to that of <hi>Marke,</hi> there one of the twelve, that did eat with him in the ſame diſh which all did, here he it is that Chriſt gave a ſop unto when he had dipped it; there one of the twelve, here which of the twelve; there none could be ſatisfied who was the Traytor; here <hi>John</hi> only could tell that it was <hi>Judas,</hi> and indeed <hi>John</hi> knew the Traytor, but did not diſcover him. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more things might be added, but I have done more then I intended, to clear up the Evangelical Harmony in relation to <hi>Judas</hi> his receiving the Lords Supper. <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> are clear for the affirmative, and <hi>John</hi> you may clearly ſee in his 13. ch. ſpeaks not at all of the Paſſeover Supper, but of that Supper at <hi>Bethany,</hi> which all the other make mention of too as well as he, they larger in relating of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; he of other particulars, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this holy Hiſtory. Hence it may be clearly concluded that <hi>Judas</hi> received the Sacrament; <hi>And they all drunk of it, Mark.</hi> 14.23. And now you may eaſily ſee what foundation Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> firſt convincing argument ſtands upon, to prove that there ſhould be Examination, and differencing of men in order to Reformation, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthy receivers. Chriſt though he knew <hi>Judas</hi> to be a Devil, and had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be the Traytor unto <hi>John,</hi> yet he gives both the Paſſeover and Sacrament of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53614:181"/>his body and bloud to <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt the reſt, without any differencing act of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet not without telling him ſmartly of his ſin, and the judgements of God ready to follow thereupon; which left him more without excuſe.</p>
                  <p>I come now to his ſecond Argument;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The means and the end come under the ſame command; Now we finde the end commanded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ones are forbidden, and denyed. Who will ſay that Ignorant and ſcandalous in life are to be admitted? Now this being granted any proper and ſufficient way to this end; Namely, the excluſion of the unfit: cannot want a probation from the Word, for the end is attained by means, and is in vain ſet forth without them,</hi> pag. 157.</p>
                  <p>I grant thoſe that are forbidden to come,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> there are means to be uſed to exclude them; but I deny the Minor, that Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for ignorance meerly, or ſcandalous lives are forbidden to come, untill all due means have been uſed to reform them; as namely, admonition private, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Excommunication; untill then, I will ſay all Church-members of years ought to be admitted. That which is the onely thing in queſtion, he would have it granted him; as that unworthy ones, (as he cals them) are forbidden: but who in the Church are they? I would gladly know; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome that did eat and drink unworthily: but it doth not follow
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53614:182"/>therefore that their perſons were unworthy, becauſe ſome of their actions were. I have inſiſted largely upon this in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Collins.</hi> The truth is, how can they be ſaid to be forbidden, that are of the Church and baptized, and as ſuch are under the command of all inſtitute worſhip? Nay it's a queſtion whether Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe diſoblige from precepts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, although the Church may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the benefit of all worſhip in the puniſhing of impenitent ſcandalous ſinners for their amendment. A priſon doth not excuſe a Fellon from duties of publick worſhip, when he by his own ſinning hath brought himſelf juſtly under that reſtraint. And in his ſaying, Any proper and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way to the excluſion of the unfit. I know no way but Juridical cenſures of the Church that is proper according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel rule, Juridical Admonition and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication the Word hath preſcribed directly, and that only is proper and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the excluſion of the unfit; as for any other way to be proper that is no where to be found in the Scripture, and neglect to doe as it is written, is but a raw ſancy of a mans own framing, and puniſhable by the Scriptures, as is clear in the caſe of <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Levit.</hi> 10.1, 2. they invented a proper and a ſufficient way in kindling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fire to conſume the Sacrifice of Incenſe,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53614:182"/>the fire of the Tabernacle being out through their own negligence; but the Lord deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with fire from heaven, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to offer that which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not. For where the Lord himſelf preſcribes a way, the Church is bound on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that way, not any way; but that only of Gods own preſcribing will he be pleaſed with. God will be ſanctified in them that come nigh him. Now then I ſay, when we upon Church reforming, through the ſubtilty of ſome, and careleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of others, have loſt the exerciſe of the Churches diſcipline: being out of actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, through our own default, as to the edification of the whole, ſhall any be ſo bold now, as to invade this authoritative power, and aſſume to themſelves without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Church the exerciſe of diſcipline? and under that pretence uſe any way that is but proper and ſufficient to exclude the ignorant and ſcandalous from the Sacrament? when the Lord hath preſcribed a direct way what is to be done with the ſcandalous in the Church. Again, that the Ark ſhould be fetched unto its proper place, was an (end) commanded, yet any proper and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means ſubſervient thereunto were not warrantable; but that way and means only that God had appointed: and you know <hi>David</hi> ſwerved from the preſcription in fetching back the Ark, but the Lord made a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53614:183"/>breach upon them for it, in ſmiting <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi> that he dyed. This way was proper and ſufficient to attain the end, yet they were puniſhed for it. The Lord made a breach amongſt them, becauſe they carryed not the Ark according to that order God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Law. It's a dangerous and deſperate attempt to invent ways and means of excluſion of Chriſts viſible ſubjects from their native rights otherwiſe then it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. There is a clear rule for Juridical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and in what caſes, and by whom to be exerciſed; and let that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all, untill they can finde further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Scriptures to warrant their other proceedings, under the notion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline in this giddy age. The Reader may ſufficiently by this ſee the weakneſſe and vanity of the way and practiſe defended by the Author. I have fully anſwered the texts of Scripture and the reaſons added as ſeconds to warrant their way, they muſt either finde out a better warrant then is yet produced; or elſe as the ten Tribes were jealous of the other two and a half, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. when they heard that the two had erected an Altar of their own heads, conceived they were in a ſuperſtitious rebellion, in forſake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wayes of the Lord, and ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord unto anger to puniſh the whole Congregation, as in the matter of <hi>Peor</hi> and <hi>Achan;</hi> ſo may we be jealous and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53614:183"/>ſuſpicious of theſe new invented wayes, ſo vigorouſly acted in by our brethren, which tend ſo evidently to make diviſion and ſchiſm in the Church, and is ſuch an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, that doth obſtruct and make void all hopes of attaining unto that diſcipline, that God hath preſcribed for the health and welfare of the whole Church. They cannot ſay as the two Tribes of their Altar, It is not for ſacrifice, but for a witneſſe to the other Tribes that their children had part in the Lord, and in the Altar that he had commanded to be built for ſacrifice and worſhip. For the way that Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends is for worſhip, and held forth as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the prejudice of profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that have any intereſt in the Lord, and in all his commanded worſhip that you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from, and upon the matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant them, and their children from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a part in the Lord. Doe you think it but a ſmall evill to your profeſſing people to deprive them of the benefit and bleſſing of Goſpel appointments, inſtituted by the Lord himſelf for the ſpiritual good of his viſible Church, of which your people are members and within? What know you but it may lye heavy upon your ſouls, if ever you be reduced into ſtraights and tryals, to think of the wrong you have done to your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſouls in withholding that from them, which was neceſſary? You think (now)
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53614:184"/>the fault is your peoples, and that they keep themſelves away from the Sacrament; they may be admitted if they will; for you ſay it's more for want of a will, then of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that they are not admitted. But by your leave Sir, may I preſume to ſpeak one word on the peoples behalf? you impoſe ſuch laws and ties upon their conſciences in order to admiſſion, that you cannot in the leaſt make good by the authority of your Maſter, you pretend very much to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in thoſe very things, which are meerly your own fancies, and inconſiſtent with your own principles otherwayes. I dare boldly ſay that you are in ſuch a way, (and ſtickle to defend it too) that you will never while you live be able to produce one plain text of Scripture, (allowing it its own ſenſe) to juſtifie either the forming of your Church, or to prove any one thing of what you ſtand upon as neceſſary to admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: you have quoted 15. texts to prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and ſuſpenſion only, and not one will in the leaſt favour you as hath bin diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered already, and in your laying down ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things to qualifie unto receiving, you quote about ſixty texts, and I have ſearched after them, I dare ſay it and juſtifie it too, that there is not one text of all that number in the leaſt pertinent to prove any one of the qualifications, as laid down to be neceſſary to this end; namely, to admiſſion to the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53614:184"/>holy Supper. And how would you have your people to come up to your tearms, when you ſo evidently wreſt the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to juſtifie the boldneſſe of venting forth your own fancies in the name of the Lord? This is the way you are agreed of, and you rejoyce in your comforts, and applaud it for purity, and you are reſolved thus to walk, and you cry up Goſpel rule: and yet your actings are not conſonant to any rule the Scripture teach; for any thing you have ſaid in defence of your way. May not your comforts be ſuſpected, as well as others, whoſe wayes and courſes are dangerous, and to be avoided? I would have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, for theſe unneceſſary ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a true Church, (as you confeſſe of ours) are abſolutely ſchiſmatical: and your people are bound to decline your way, and to keep their ſtation in the Church into which they are imbodyed, and to uſe all their indeavours to partake of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances where they may, without running themſelves into ſuch dangerous ſchiſms that directly tend to the confuſion of the whole. And without doubt if you will be as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous as you expreſſe, you muſt either return to your diſtracted flocks and perform thoſe relative duties you ſtand bound unto, or perſiſt in wayes of your own chooſing, meerly without the words warranty, which is ſcandalous in the Church of Chriſt,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53614:185"/>ſo to doe and deſerves to be cenſured.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> after his arguments, he gives ſome motives which he would have his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lay to heart the evils following the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them, or the like courſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>And chiefly God is provoked to remove our Candleſtick, for neglect of Church cenſures upon ſcandalous offenders: A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.6.</p>
                  <p>I deny that the way defended hath any thing of the Church cenſures in it according to that text,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> for Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> ſaith, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate none, and Excommunication (alone) is meant by this Scripture. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not ſay, Separate the meal from the leaven, but purge out the leaven from the meal, he doth not ſay, exclude the ſcandalous. from the Sacrament, but put out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelves ſuch wicked perſons: that is, out of all Chriſtian Communion, civill or ſacred. What is their courſe to this Text, when they Juridically cenſure none, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are in a capacity ſo to doe? Caſting out of the Church, and leaving out from the Sacrament thoſe that are within, are huge different things; the firſt is lawful and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Goſpel rule, the other unlawful, as being againſt all Goſpel rules or precedents. It's true, the neglect of Church cenſures where a Church is in ſuch a capacity, is a great evill, that doth much provoke the Lord to puniſh ſuch neglect, and that we are in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53614:185"/>this capacity at preſent, ſome have more to anſwer for, then I fear they are ſenſible of, nor humbled under that direful guilt; my prayer to God is to make us all ſenſible of our malady, and in his due time reſtore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this poor rent and divided Church that remedy of holy diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond evil is, <hi>The confuſion of ſouls by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and common profanation; eating and drinking their own damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is high indeed for words,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> but hath not that dreadful doome in it as he reports with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out better proof: ordinary and common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation in the Scripture ſenſe was never read of. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> lay under the guilt of high profanation, but it was not ordinary or common I think. 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they never offended ſo again, nor any other Church: what their ſin was ſhould be enquired after more ſtrictly, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted, and then judge whether the Sacrament be, for the confuſion of ſouls; it was a temporal chaſtiſement to prevent the damnation of ſouls. This to the puniſhment: The ſin was a ſacrilegious miſuſe of holy things to carnal and common ends in the very act of adminiſtration, which I have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given my thoughts of, and ſhewed that not any Congregations in our Church did ever or rarely ſo offend; and what he meanes by common profanation, muſt be ſome other thing, that the Scripture no where condemns,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53614:186"/>otherwiſe then in every other Ordinance of God, that is too careleſly performed. As all other Ordinances, ſo this was inſtituted for the ſpiritual good of the Church; Chriſt commands nothing for the hurt of his viſible ſubjects, they conforming thereunto accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their preſent capacity: the Lord gives his laws and Ordinances for our good only: Sometimes he permits a people for their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to chuſe Ordinances and ſtatutes of their own making for their hurt, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old did. I conclude then, that this evil, the confuſion of ſouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a ſlander of Gods Ordinance, and an evill of mens own making, when applied to the Sacrament more then to all other Ordinances in the Church. — Next,</p>
                  <p>He ſaith in his third place, <hi>Abuſe of the bloud of Chriſt by being too prodigal hereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <label type="milestone">

                     </label> They properly abuſe the ſigns of Chriſts bloud, that ſlight Sacraments as too mean and carnal to uſe to that end they were inſtituted for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They who admit Heathens and give the holy Supper to perſons unbaptized, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, or to thoſe that come on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to abuſe the ſigns to common ends. But to adminiſter the Sacrament unto ſerious profeſſing Chriſtians that come reverently, and demean themſelves orderly according to the external part of this obſervance, is that which is according unto Goſpel rule, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53614:186"/>the adminiſtration holy and warrantable; Chriſt that gave himſelf for his Church, doth not think much of giving the ſigns and repreſentations of himſelf, body and bloud to the members thereof. And who will plead for any but Church-members, who are under the obligation of this obſervance of their Lord? And to deny it to ſuch, is to be more withholding then is meet, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to Jeſus Chriſt, who came into the world to ſave ſinners.</p>
                  <p>His fourth is, <hi>Obſtructing the reformation of the Churches we live in.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </label> but to draw on the whole to a conformity to all the Laws of Jeſus Chriſt, externally at leaſt? For the Church can goe no further; it is the only work of God to reform the hearts of men. And the whole Church are as much bound to a conformity to this law of receiving the Sacrament in remembrance of Chriſt, as to any other act of obedience in the Church. He that commands all the reſt of obedience, commands this too: And therefore they underſtand not what Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is, that are buſie in ſuch reformings in their Churches, that the greateſt part of Chriſts ſubjects are out of carleſſeneſſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and exempted from their duty of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; Nay thoſe that would ſerve their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Lord and Saviour in the command of his own worſhip, as they are believing
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53614:187"/>Chriſtians, in hope of his mercy and bleſſing to their ſouls, are diſcouraged and hindred by theſe pretenders to reform: They ſhut up the Kingdome of Heaven againſt poor ſouls, that as ſinners would be entring in and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to their Saviour. They forbid whom Chriſt commands to ſerve him in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and in reforming of their Churches they make void the commands of Chriſt by their own traditions; which wayes tend more to the deſtruction and confuſion of Churches then in the leaſt the reforming of them.</p>
                  <p>His fifth is, <hi>Croſſing the deſire of the godly in the land, and the actings of the State herein.</hi>

                     </label> that lets Chriſt into the ſouls of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for it's ſuppoſed that ſome have Chriſt in their ſouls in their Infancy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt firſt comes into a dark ſoul, that hath no other but a paſſive reception, and he alone brings true and ſaving light with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If no more knowledge be required to actual receiving of the Sacrament, then to a paſſive reception of Chriſt, where Chriſt pleaſeth by his Spirit. Firſt to take hold on ſouls, we may conſent to this: but if he mean ſo much light and faith, whereby a man is capable actually to apply ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual bleſſing by Chriſt, it requires proof; the bare ſayings of men meerly are not competent to weigh with the Churches peace and truth; ſo much concerned in this practice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How weak is all that they can ſay in defence of this qualification to admiſſion to the Lords Supper, when ours are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized (and within) and therefore under the actual obſervance of this duty as any other; himſelf ſaith well of a wicked mans praying thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their preſence at the duty can be no ſin, while 'tis that they are commanded to doe: though at preſent their own evils make them unable to doe as

I ſay would but men thus judge and ſay of the Sacrament, there being the ſame reaſon for it, as is proved clearly in another place: this controverſie would be ended, and all parties pleaſed. Beſides there is not any law or rule in Scriptures to warrant the puniſhing of ignorance, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracie in the Church with the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a common priviledge belonging to members in common of the ſame kinde: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſuch a thing heard of in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Churches, that any were cenſured for ignorance in excluding them from the Lords Table, or from any other Ordinance in the Church. If you judge ours within, and baptized, and of years, and yet exclude them the Sacrament for want of knowledge: I dare be bold to ſay, that you venture to doe that which you have neither Scripture precept, nor counſel, nor precedent for: How you think to be born out in ſuch a bold preſumptuous practice againſt the clear command of Chriſt, you may doe well to conſider of it. His quotations are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent for his purpoſe, that it will be but loſſe of time and labour to examine them. I admire how men dare ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly

That receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is ſo alſo, (it being a publick duty of worſhip incumbent upon all in the Church, and comprehended in his laſt) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That theſe qualifications are neceſſary in order to Gods glory and our Salvation is confeſſed: but that they are neceſſary in order to receiving to the Sacrament (upon good grounds) is to be denyed untill better proof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe qualifications are neceſſary to prove our ſpiritual ſtates by, and to know in what condition we ſtand in before the Lord. But the Scriptures quoted doe not in the leaſt urge them as prerequiſite unto the Lords Supper, more then to all other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They that have this Book, let them

And if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde one of ſo great a number for his purpoſe, had it not been more for his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (as he is a Miniſter) not to have quoted them, then thus abſurdly to miſapply them to juſtifie a way themſelves have inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately choſen? It's the uſual road of thoſe that have ſtrong fancies and weak judgements to multiply texts of Scriptures impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If this Author ſhall think it neceſſary ſtill to defend their way, I much deſire that he may ſhew himſelf a workman that need not be aſhamed by dividing the pure truths of God aright: one clear and rational deduction from the holy Scripture properly applyed either for ſuſpenſion or examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or excluding the ignorant, would doe more to juſtifie the ſeparations that ſome venture to make amongſt their people in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Sacrament, then multitude of texts impertinently alleadged, as hath been diſcovered. Nay it's a ſtrange thing, and to be wondred at, that the ſame men that doe ſatisfie themſelves, touching Infant Baptiſm, upon the Analogy of Circumciſion, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation according to the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, without any expreſſe rule in the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53614:197"/>New Teſtament, in reſpect of precept or precedent. And yet the ſame men will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt the Analogy of the Paſſeover, notwithſtanding we have clear precept and precedent in the New to warrant the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of years to receive the Lords Supper. If the ſame men ſhould be as exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Analogy of Circumciſion to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as of the Paſſeover to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: they would utterly throw away the cauſe and run to the tents of our adverſaries; both weak and worthleſſe is that of Mr. <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in reply to Mr. <hi>Humfry,</hi> upon the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Paſſeover, <hi>pag.</hi> 185. <hi>The Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over had an external benefit which all did partake of, therefore a right to that Ordinance ſo far as external: but the Lords Supper is a more, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ordinance, no type.

                  <p n="2">2. It concerns the Author to make good the firſt thing aſſerted, That all had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal benefit by it, more then what was eaten and drunk to the ſatisfying of nature, for all that came under the Law of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53614:197"/>were not in <hi>Egypt</hi> to partake of that benefit of preſervation, when the firſt born of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were ſlain. What think you of the generations that were then to come ſucceſſively untill Chriſt? Nor were all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſmitten with that death, but the firſt born only. Beſides, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal benefit were this to the Aliens and ſtrangers that were Proſelytes, and came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Circumciſion? they were as much under the Law of the Paſſeover as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and yet did not partake of that external benefit, and therefore that was not the thing that gave them right as he pretends. And whereas he ſaith, the Lords Supper is more ſpiritual, it is to be proved, the Paſſeover having the ſame Author appointing it for the ſame ſpiritual uſe and ends in the Church with the holy Supper. The external Ceremonial part of the one and of the other both alike carnal: and his granting, that both are the ſame for ſubſtance, as to the uſe and end, doth croſſe and contradict this of his here: let it be proved that the unregenerate and wicked in the Church are not to be tearmed Gods people now. Doe not the Apoſtles give equal titles to all in the Church; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them Saints, and ſuch as were brethren and within, although ſcandalous and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born? and if the unregenerate and wicked in the Church, are not to be tearmed Gods
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53614:198"/>people, how are their children holy fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that being affirmed only of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believers, which himſelf grants, which is croſſe to <hi>Camero.</hi> And the truth is, the arguments we urge from the Paſſeover, Covenant relation, ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, Goſpel precept, and precedents, the right of memberſhip, the love of Chriſt to ſinners, are ſo ſolid and full of ſtrength, that all that oppoſe us will be aſhamed at laſt.</p>
                  <p>There is no need of any further examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what is writ by this Author in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>Humfry,</hi> for had he conſulted with what was written of late before his came out, he might have ſpared that part as unneceſſary, he having but little that's new, conſiderable in the controverſie. If the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor want work, let him anſwer Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys</hi> rejoynder, or the laſt part of my firſt Book not yet anſwered, or make good his own ſo clearly confuted, if he can: Or elſe return to the Church in feeding his own flock, and be quiet, endeavouring to heal the breach, which by an unneceſſary ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath ſinfully made in his Church.</p>
                  <p>I ſhal now take my leave of my Reader, and end with ſome Apologizing reaſons, why I have appeared ſo ſtiff in oppoſing of theſe petty irregular reformings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they have no foundation to ſtand upon from the Scriptures.</p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:53614:198"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they hinder and obſtruct the Reformation of the whole: Who will deſire or endeavour after a uniformity of true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, if theſe private petty wayes will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end without it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe Suſpenſion and Separation makes void Juridical. Excommunication, the only ſeparating Ordinance in the Church, and now upon the matter is wholly loſt in Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe theſe new contrivances tend to wicked diviſion and ſchiſm in the Church, and a complying with that wilde Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of tolerating every Sect and way, to the ſcandal of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe theſe groundleſſe partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formings do make us inſenſible of our mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſo careleſſe of the right remedy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe this groundleſſe pretended diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline runs private Miniſters upon intruding the power of Juriſdiction, which as private Miniſters they are not impowered with at all, untill the Church have choſe and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto Eccleſiaſtical rule and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: for all are not competent for that work, nor is it neceſſary that all ſhould bear a ſhare in the exerciſe of Church cenſures and policies.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe I judge that not any Miniſter in the Church can juſtly aſſume an authoritative power of Juriſdiction in his Church by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Ordination and Induction.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:53614:199"/>
                  <p>And laſtly, what Reformation can be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally expected, when thoſe that ſhould be intruſted with the exerciſe of diſcipline, are wryed in their judgements about the cenſures of the Church, and in what caſes to correct, and who ſhould have the exerciſe thereof? Whether every Presbyter in general, or ſome peculiarly choſen, and ſet apart for Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical rule and order only? What work would have been made in the Church by this, if the Presbyterian principles had been put into execution? We ſhould have had but few Communicants in many of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, had that rigid way of Examination and power in the Elderſhip to ſuſpend upon pleaſure gone on. When the Lord of his Church is pleaſed to bleſſe this poor diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church with ſo great a bleſſing, as true and holy diſcipline is; he will both qualifie and furniſh us with inſtruments fit for that work; in the mean time let us pray and wait, and uſe all good means we can to poſſeſſe ſo great a mercy, as may truly tend to the Reformation of the whole, without the hurt or prejudice of any part of Chriſts viſible Church.</p>
